<p class="ph2">BOMBA<br>
THE JUNGLE BOY<br>
ON JAGUAR ISLAND</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>WHAT THE LIGHTNING REVEALED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> crouched beneath the shelter of an
overhanging rock, straining his ears for a faint
sound not born of the storm.</p>

<p>The rain was coming down in a pitiless torrent.
The thunder battered against the surrounding
hills and went off grumbling into the distance, to
be swallowed up in louder detonations. Trees
bent before the fury of the wind like a bow in
the hands of an archer. Some of the smaller
trunks, wrenched from their roots, fell with a
thud to the ground. Castanha nuts, like pebbles
from the sling shot of a giant, pelted the jungle
in a deadly hail. It was a devastating storm
that for the time subdued all other forces of the
jungle.</p>

<p>None but the ears of the boy of the jungle could
have detected that faint sound through the clamor
of the tempest. None but the eyes of Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
could have seen that something that stood out
like a black blot against the vivid background
of the lightning.</p>

<p>Bomba crouched lower beneath the jutting rock
and one hand slipped to the belt at his waist,
firmly gripping the handle of his razor-edged
knife. Whether man, beast or reptile threatened,
Bomba was not to be caught off his guard.</p>

<p>A crash of thunder that seemed to rip the
very heavens asunder, a flash of lightning like a
jagged finger of fire searing the sky, and again
Bomba saw that blot, but this time more distinctly.</p>

<p>With a smothered exclamation, Bomba slipped
into the narrow gully that ran behind the rock,
a gully, now half filled with water but thickly
fringed with bushes, concealing him from the
eyes of his enemies.</p>

<p>For the flash of lightning had revealed no lurking
jaguar, hungry for its prey. The foes of
Bomba were of a far deadlier kind, deadlier even
than the wicked anaconda with its folds of steel.
For these were headhunters—bloodthirsty, cruel,
cunning—bucks of the tribe of the dreaded chief,
Nascanora.</p>

<p>The eyes of Bomba, keen as those of the big
cats that stalked the jungle, had counted three of
these in the brief space of the lightning flash.
They stood like naked statues, each gripping a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
spear, the eyes of each prodding the deeper
shadows beneath the overhanging rock.</p>

<p>Rage was in the heart of the jungle boy, and
fear; fear not for himself but for Cody Casson,
his one white friend who had reared him from
infancy; Cody Casson, now frail and wasted, who
lay helpless, perhaps close to death, in the hut
of Pipina, the squaw.</p>

<p>Bomba knew with a sure instinct the reason for
the presence of the headhunters of Nascanora,
now far from their tribal abode in the shadow
of the Giant Cataract. They were once more
on the trail of Casson; Casson whom Bomba
loved. They would try to capture him, take him
to their village and torture him, and then, when
death had brought an end to his sufferings, place
his head on Nascanora’s wigwam.</p>

<p>The hand of Bomba clutched convulsively at
the handle of his knife. He vowed to the gods
of the thunder and the rain that he would protect
his friend to the last gasp; that if Casson
were to die, he, Bomba, would die with him,
stretched across his body.</p>

<p>But it was too early yet to think of death.
Too long had Bomba braved the perils of the
jungle not to know the fleetness of his foot, the
sureness of his eye, the strength of his muscles.
Bomba had fought the braves of Nascanora’s
tribe before; had beaten and outwitted them. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
would fight them again, matching his strength
against their strength, his brain against their
brain. And he told himself that Bomba would
win.</p>

<p>Stealthily as a shadow, still crouching low behind
the bushes, Bomba crept along the gully,
his ears strained for any sound that might indicate
pursuit.</p>

<p>Had they seen him? Had his form beneath the
shadow of the rock been as plain to them as theirs
to him?</p>

<p>Bomba doubted this, for the rock was sheltered
by the overhanging limbs of trees, while
the Indians had stood up straight, clearly outlined
against the tangled undergrowth of the
jungle.</p>

<p>The advantage so far was Bomba’s. But how
long could he hope to retain it?</p>

<p>Bomba pushed against the wind almost as
against a solid obstacle. It required all his
strength to keep his feet. The lightning, that was
now almost incessant, filled the forest with weird
light, illuminating the tree branches and swaying
vines in a fantastic tracery. Heavy ropes of
creepers swung from the branches above the boy’s
head and wrapped themselves about him, impeding
his progress.</p>

<p>With teeth gritted, Bomba fought the fury of
the storm. It was terrible, but not so ruthless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
and relentless as the enemy he was trying to leave
behind.</p>

<p>An unusually vivid flash of lightning illumined
a faint trail at Bomba’s right. He would leave the
gully here and strike homeward toward the cabin
of Pipina, where Casson lay, all unknowing of
the danger that threatened him. He had been
on his way there when the storm had risen and
forced him to seek shelter beneath the lee of the
rock.</p>

<p>A tree fell with the sound of rending branches
directly in front of him. The outflung boughs
caught him, swept him backward; castanha nuts
pelted about him, now just grazing him and again
leaving painful bruises on his body.</p>

<p>He freed himself and struggled doggedly onward.
It was not far to the hut of Pipina now,
but, pursued by the demons of the storm and
having to hack his way at times through the underbrush,
each yard had to be fought for.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, Bomba stopped.</p>

<p>His hand grasped tightly the hilt of his knife,
his eyes narrowed as they searched an especially
heavy clump of bushes.</p>

<p>Another flash illumined the thicket and Bomba
saw the ugly head of a jararaca, the rattlesnake
of the South American jungle, upraised to strike.</p>

<p>As the world was again bathed in blackness the
serpent sprang. At the same instant Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
dodged, his hand darted forward and caught the
reptile by the neck. His fingers closed upon that
slimy neck like a ring of steel. The snake writhed
fearfully and threw its coils about Bomba’s arm.</p>

<p>Had the lad’s fingers relaxed the merest trifle,
the fangs would have found their mark. But
those fingers kept up their relentless pressure until
the thrashing coils gradually grew limp.</p>

<p>To make assurance doubly sure, Bomba beat
the reptile’s head against a rock, then flung the
hideous thing far from him into the bushes.</p>

<p>“The snake is quick,” said the boy to himself,
in justified pride, “but Bomba is quicker.”</p>

<p>He plunged forward again, but in a moment
stopped, listening intently. What was that?</p>

<p>Only the threshing of the rain, the roar of the
wind?</p>

<p>No, it was different from either of these. It
was the sound of one or several bodies pressing
through the heavy undergrowth that in places
grew higher than a man’s head.</p>

<p>And it was not the body of a jaguar or a puma
that was pushing through the thickets. Bomba
was familiar enough with the habits of these
creatures to know that on a night like this they
would remain closely sheltered in their caves.
None of them would brave the fury of the elements.</p>

<p>Nor was it the odor of animals that was borne<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
to him. Bomba’s long residence in the jungle had
developed his sense of smell so that it was almost
as keen as that of the jaguar itself. His nostrils
dilated now as he sniffed the air and caught the
unmistakable scent of human kind.</p>

<p>He had thought that he had left his enemies
behind. Now he knew that they were also in
front. It was from that direction that the scent
had come.</p>

<p>It was no small party with which he had to
deal. Nascanora’s braves were out in force. All
Bomba’s subtlety and force would be needed that
night, if he were to keep his head on his shoulders.
And Bomba valued that head highly.</p>

<p>He went forward now more slowly, more cautiously,
pausing to look about him warily when
the lightning illumined the jungle.</p>

<p>At one brilliant flash he dropped behind some
bushes as though shot.</p>

<p>Not more than a dozen yards away three
Indians were creeping toward him, spear points
lowered, glinting evilly!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>AT GRIPS WITH THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> a flash Bomba leaped to his feet and
plunged into the underbrush.</p>

<p>He was not a moment too soon! With a yell,
the headhunters sprang toward the spot where he
had been but a moment before.</p>

<p>Had Bomba been on a level plain, he could
have laughed at his pursuers, for none of them
matched him in fleetness of foot. But when it
came to forcing his way through the heavy brush,
they could move almost as quickly as himself, and
the noise he made would be a sure guide to his
pursuers.</p>

<p>Realizing this, Bomba adopted new tactics.
With the litheness of a deer he rose in the air,
and with a series of successive bounds rapidly
increased the distance between him and the enemy.
He hurdled the bushes in great leaps while his
heavier foes were forcing their way through
them.</p>

<p>At times he came to places where long creepers
depended from the trees, and in order to rest his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
legs he swung himself along by his arms from
one to the other with incredible celerity.</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart sang within him as the sounds
of pursuit became fainter. But just as he was
beginning to feel that he had escaped the most
pressing danger a chorus of yells came from somewhere
in front of him. These were answered by
savage shouts in the rear.</p>

<p>To go on would be to throw himself into the
hands of his foes. To retreat would be equally
dangerous.</p>

<p>Turning to the nearest tree, Bomba shinned up
it with the agility of a monkey and sought refuge
in the thick foliage that hid him from sight, while
yet permitting him to see what might be going
on below.</p>

<p>What was in that tree he did not know. Perhaps
a boa constrictor wound about one of the
branches. But he must take his chance between
possible death there and the almost certain death
that threatened him on the ground beneath.</p>

<p>He had scarcely ensconced himself, panting,
in the fork of two great branches before a dozen
or more Indians were under his refuge, jabbering
with rage and disappointment. They had
thought they had their prey encircled and that all
they had to do was to close in upon it. Now it
had vanished as though into thin air.</p>

<p>With their spears and machetes they viciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
beat the brushwood to right and left, thrusting
their weapons into every thicket, their anger
growing as their efforts remained fruitless.</p>

<p>At last they paused and grouped themselves together
for consultation. Bomba’s eyes strained
through the darkness, trying to ascertain their
number. His ears sought also to get what they
were saying. Had it not been for the noise of
the tempest, he might have succeeded in this, for
he was familiar with most of the dialects of the
jungle dwellers. But all he could hear was a
low growl that conveyed to him no meaning.</p>

<p>Then the sound of voices died away and the
only noise was that of the storm. The black
mass of figures had dissolved. Bomba seemed to
be alone.</p>

<p>Had the headhunters passed on? Had they
been warned perhaps of some danger that menaced
them as well as the fugitive?</p>

<p>For a moment the heart of the jungle lad leaped
with hope. Then his sensitive ear caught a
rustling that he knew was not occasioned by the
wind.</p>

<p>No, they had not gone. Some, perhaps, but
not all.</p>

<p>A lightning flash more dazzling than any that
had gone before rent the darkness of the jungle,
flooding it with weird, unearthly light. In that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
flash Bomba caught sight of several Indians
crouched in the vicinity of the tree.</p>

<p>There came a rending, splintering crash that
nearly shattered his eardrums, a detonation that
seemed to shake the earth.</p>

<p>A giant tree near by, struck to the heart by the
bolt, toppled and crashed toward the earth. The
Indians yelled and tried to flee. A blood-curdling
scream rang through the jungle as the tree trunk
thudded to the ground.</p>

<p>Bomba sensed what had happened. There was
only one meaning to that scream.</p>

<p>“The storm does Bomba’s work better than he
can do it himself,” muttered the lad.</p>

<p>If he had had any doubt that death had occurred,
another flash showed that he had made
no mistake. The great tree in falling had caught
one of the Indians beneath it, crushing the life
from his body instantly. The other savages were
not visible, and Bomba rightly guessed that they
would believe the spot to be under a curse and
would shun it as they would the plague.</p>

<p>“They will not come back to-night,” reasoned
the jungle lad, “and to-morrow will be too late,
for Bomba will not be here.”</p>

<p>With Bomba, to think was to act. Reaching
out, he clutched a handful of creepers and slid to
the ground. He paused a moment to get his
direction and then vanished into the underbrush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>There was no sign of his foes, and Bomba
blessed that lightning stroke that had sent them
in panic flight. Not for the next ten minutes
did anything happen to give him alarm.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, he was struck from
behind and fell to the ground. The sound of a
guttural voice was in his ears and sinewy fingers
wound themselves about his throat.</p>

<p>While the jungle boy struggles desperately to
loose that strangling hold, it may be well, for the
benefit of those who have not read the preceding
volumes of this series, to tell who Bomba was and
what had been his adventures up to the time this
story opens.</p>

<p>Bomba could never remember a time when he
had not lived in the jungle. His only companion
and guardian was Cody Casson, an aged naturalist,
who had withdrawn from civilization and
the life of white people to settle in one of the
remotest recesses of the Amazonian jungle.
Whether he was related to him, Bomba did not
know and had never wondered. He would not
have known the meaning of relative. He only
knew that he loved Casson and that Casson loved
him, although the latter seldom demonstrated any
affection in words, spending days at a time in
moody abstraction.</p>

<p>The old man’s state had grown worse after a
certain memorable day when he had fired a gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
at an anaconda which was threatening to attack
Bomba and the weapon had burst in his hands.
The reptile was wounded by the flying missiles and
retreated, but Casson had received a serious injury
to his head. Bomba nursed him back to
some degree of physical health, but Casson from
that time on was half-demented, and the care of
providing for the two had fallen on the lad’s
shoulders.</p>

<p>For such youthful shoulders it was a heavy
burden, but it helped to develop the lad into a
wonder of strength and daring. Dangers of all
kinds surrounded him, wild beasts and reptiles
with which the jungle swarmed, and only quick
wit and dauntless courage could preserve his life.
But necessity is a hard taskmaster, and under its
spur Bomba learned all the craft of the jungle.
Keen of eye, swift of foot, supple of muscle, and
strong of heart, he matched himself against his
foes and so far had come out the victor. He was
now about fourteen years old, but few grown
men had his strength and resources.</p>

<p>Of the outside world he knew nothing. All
his life was circumscribed by the jungle. Casson
had started to give him a smattering of learning,
but the explosion of the rifle had brought this to
an abrupt stop.</p>

<p>So Bomba roamed the jungle like a young faun
at the beginning of the world. His face was as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
bronzed as that of an Indian from constant exposure
to sun and storm. But there was undeniable
proof in his features, in his aquiline nose,
his firm jaw, his brown hair and eyes, that he was
of white blood. He wore the native tunic, or
mendiyeh, and a puma skin was slung across his
breast—that of Geluk the puma that he had come
across and killed when it was trying to slay the
friendly parrots, Kiki and Woowoo. Beneath
his bare arms and legs powerful muscles glided
and rippled. Homemade sandals encased his feet.</p>

<p>His weapons consisted of a bow and arrows,
and he wore at his belt a machete, or two-edged
knife, fully a foot in length, a fearful blade when
it came to hand-to-hand fighting. In addition he
had a five-chambered revolver, the only firearm
of which he was possessed, and which had been
given to him by two white rubber hunters after
he had rendered them a signal service.</p>

<p>Despite its perils, he loved the life of the
jungle, and but for one thing would have been
reasonably happy. That thing was the consciousness
of his white blood. It tugged at his heart,
and while it gave him pride, it also tormented
him. The call of the blood was strong within
him. He knew that, somehow, he was out of
place. Something was always calling him to go
elsewhere, beckoning him on to new horizons, telling
him that he belonged to the white people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>He had a great yearning to know of his parentage.
He had not the slightest memory of his
father or mother. Again and again he had questioned
Casson on this point, but the old man’s
memory always failed him at the very moment
of revelation. In these efforts to recall the past
Casson had frequently muttered the words “Bartow”
and “Laura,” and Bomba had inferred that
the names were those of his father and mother.
But the further knowledge he craved was denied
him.</p>

<p>How Bomba saved the camp of Gillis and
Dorn, rubber hunters, from a night attack by
jaguars—how he trapped the deadly cooanaradi,
the most dreaded serpent of the South American
wilds, when it pursued him; his adventures with
alligators and anacondas; the besieging of his
cabin by the headhunters; how his friends of the
forest came to his aid when he was fearfully beset;
all this is narrated in the first volumes of
this series, entitled: “Bomba, the Jungle Boy; or,
The Old Naturalist’s Secret.”</p>

<p>Later on, Casson told Bomba that, though he
himself could not remember the facts about the
lad’s parentage, the latter could get that information
from Jojasta, the medicine man of the
Moving Mountain. Bomba, therefore, after
providing for Casson’s safety while he should be
gone, set out to see Jojasta. From the very outset<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
his path was beset with perils. Flood and
earthquake, man and beast sought his life. He
was instrumental in delivering from the hands of
the savages a Mrs. Parkhurst and her son, Frank,
and his association with the two deepened his
desire to know more of that white civilization
with which they were so familiar. He was hurled
into a subterranean cavern, escaped by a hair’s
breadth and finally reached Jojasta and the Moving
Mountain.</p>

<p>There disappointment awaited him; but he was
told that if he could find Sobrinini, the witch who
dwelt near the Giant Cataract, she might give
him the knowledge for which his soul longed.</p>

<p>Baffled for a time but not disheartened, Bomba
resolved to search out Sobrinini, though warned
that great peril would attend the attempt. How
true that warning was he soon had reason to
learn. He fell into the power of Nascanora and
was doomed by him to torture and death. How
his quick wit saved him; the terrible dangers to
which his indomitable spirit refused to yield, and
which he finally surmounted; how he found Sobrinini
at last on her island of snakes and brought
her back with him, only to be tantalized with
imperfect revelations that made it still necessary
to hunt out Japazy on Jaguar Island is told
in the preceding volume of this series, entitled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
“Bomba, the Jungle Boy, at the Giant Cataract;
or, Chief Nascanora and His Captives.”</p>

<p>And now to return to Bomba as he writhed
and struggled to shake himself free from that
terrible grip on his throat!</p>

<p>He knew that he was fighting for his life.</p>

<p>What was it that had waited for him with the
stealth of the panther to leap upon him as he
passed?</p>

<p>That one of the headhunters of the tribe of
Nascanora had him in his grip, Bomba knew at
the first touch of those fingers of steel about his
throat.</p>

<p>Few could break the grip of the jungle Indian.
Only those bred as Bomba had been among
the very wild beasts of that tangled region could
have hoped to free himself of that strangle hold.</p>

<p>With a tremendous heave of his powerful
young shoulders Bomba flung himself upon his
back, the Indian half over him. With frantic
fingers the lad tore at that clutch about his throat.</p>

<p>Above, the thunder rumbled dourly. Dim
flashes of sheet lightning served to deepen by
contrast the darkness that enveloped the antagonists.</p>

<p>Strain as he would the lad could not force
that hold to break. His head was reeling, his
brain confused and black spots danced before his
glazing eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>A flash of lightning brighter than the rest
showed him the Indian, on whose face was an
expression of fiendish gloating.</p>

<p>That look was a spur to Bomba’s failing
senses. He thought of Casson, left defenseless
with Bomba dead, and by a mighty effort raised
himself and drove his knee with all his strength
into the flesh beneath the ribs of his antagonist.</p>

<p>The blow was a surprise to the Indian, who
counted his adversary as already beaten. He
grunted with dismay and pain. For the fraction
of an instant his grip relaxed, and in that instant
Bomba had burst the iron ring about his throat
and was on his feet.</p>

<p>With a bellow of rage the savage also sprang
upright, whipping out a short knife from his
belt.</p>

<p>But quick as he was, Bomba was quicker. He
saw the gleam of the Indian’s steel, drew his
own machete and with one stroke sent his enemy’s
weapon whizzing off into the underbrush.</p>

<p>Like a panther, the Indian sprang upon the
white boy, and before Bomba could strike home
with the machete had seized upon the lad’s hand,
striving to bend it backward and possess himself
of the machete.</p>

<p>But if the Indian was strong, so was Bomba.
He was fighting for two lives, his own and Casson’s,
and, moreover, one of his fierce rages was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
upon him; one of those wild bursts of fury that
for the moment gave him the strength of the
jaguar, the wile of the fox, the quickness of the
snake.</p>

<p>Bomba was all these in one now, as he fought
with the Indian, straining backward and forward,
resisting the pressure upon his knife arm, striving
with all the power in him to drive downward
the shining point of his machete, to sink it to
the hilt in his enemy’s flesh.</p>

<p>For some minutes the fierce struggle went on.
Then, with a sudden twist, Bomba broke the
Indian’s hold, leaped backward several feet, and
threw his machete.</p>

<p>It would have found its mark had not the
savage fallen forward with the sudden releasing
of Bomba’s pressure. The knife grazed his head.
Thrown off his balance, the savage tried to recover
himself. But the slime of mud and leaves
made treacherous footing and the Indian plunged
headlong.</p>

<p>Bomba was upon him with the swiftness of a
jaguar!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE BLAZING CABIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> such close quarters Bomba could not use
his bow, and he dared not fire the revolver lest
it attract the attention of lurking foes.</p>

<p>Rising into the air, he came down with both
feet on his enemy’s head. Then he stamped
the head into the mud and ooze till the savage
lay still.</p>

<p>Whether the man breathed or not, Bomba
did not stop to inquire. It was enough that he
had been put out of action. The noise of the
struggle, muffled as it had been, might already
be drawing others to the scene. Bomba must
act swiftly, if he were to leave the spot alive.</p>

<p>One of his precious minutes he gave to the
search for his machete. With its aid he might
still win through to Casson at the hut of Pipina.
By a stroke of good fortune he found the
weapon where it had stuck in the trunk of a
tree.</p>

<p>With a smothered cry of elation, Bomba
leaped upon it and wrenched it from its hold.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
Again and again that knife had saved his life,
and it might do it again before the night was
over.</p>

<p>Bomba’s body was bruised, he was dead
tired, but his spirit was unhurt. The thirst of
battle was still in him. His blood was hot with it.</p>

<p>Twice to-night he had outwitted his enemies.
Nascanora and his half-brother Tocarora would
again realize that he, Bomba, was as slippery
as the cooanaradi and as deadly.</p>

<p>He wasted no time. He set his feet in the
direction of the cabin of Pipina, the squaw, and
went stealthily yet swiftly through the jungle.</p>

<p>The storm had felled great trees across his
path. Some of these he climbed over, while he
took the smaller ones with a leap. Where the
ground was impassable he swung himself along
from creeper to creeper and branch to branch.
No inhabitant of the jungle save the monkeys
were as skilled in this method of progress as
Bomba, and he made his way with amazing
celerity. Never had that accomplishment stood
him in better stead.</p>

<p>His eyes and ears were alert for the slightest
sight or sound that might forebode danger. But
this did not prevent his mind from being in a
tumult of varied emotions.</p>

<p>His most anxious thought was of Casson,
Casson alone in the jungle hut save for Pipina.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
Again the headhunters sought the life of Casson.
Again was Bomba hunted like the veriest wild
beast.</p>

<p>Bitterness welled up in the heart of the lad
against these savages, whom he had never injured
except in self-defense. Why was he doomed
to spend his life among these people so alien to
him?</p>

<p>Bomba was white. All his yearnings were
toward those of his own race.</p>

<p>Who were his parents? He thought of the
picture of the beautiful woman that had hung
in the little back room of Sobrinini’s hut on the
island of snakes. That face had stirred his heart
as no other had ever done. Was the beautiful
woman his mother?</p>

<p>Who was he? What had happened to his
parents and why had he become at so early an
age the sole companion of old Cody Casson?</p>

<p>He reviewed the strange behavior of the half-mad
old woman, Sobrinini, she who had once
been the operatic idol of Europe, she who had
had kings at her feet. Why had she not finished
the story of the man named Bartow, his wife,
Laura, and the child they called Bonny?</p>

<p>Sobrinini had called him, Bomba, by the name
of Bartow. She had thought in her poor twisted
mind that Bomba was Bartow. Was it possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
that Bomba was the boy who had once been called
Bonny?</p>

<p>Bomba heaved a heavy sigh. Questions, questions
always, and no answers. Cody Casson had
the key to the mystery. But poor Casson must
first find the key to that closed door in his mind
beyond which he could not go.</p>

<p>His mind in a whirl of unrest and longing,
Bomba at last reached the river which he must
cross to reach the hut of Pipina.</p>

<p>The storm had now entirely died away. Only
the heavy dripping of moisture from the foliage
betrayed its recent passage. The jungle was still
again with an unearthly stillness. The slight
swish made by Bomba as he swung himself from
branch to branch was the only sound that broke
the silence.</p>

<p>Suddenly he paused and hung motionless, arms
and legs entwined about a bunch of creepers.
His quick ear had caught a sound other than
the dripping of water on the sodden earth.</p>

<p>It was a slight sound, but Bomba knew at
once what had caused it. It was the faint dip
of paddles in the water. The Indians were traveling
upstream. The headhunters of Nascanora
were on their way to the hut of Pipina to spread
terror and death. Fortunate if death were all!
Far worse would be the tortures of any captives
who might be carried off alive to make a holiday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
for the savages who had been left at home and
who would revel in the screams of their victims.</p>

<p>Bomba had been carrying his machete between
his teeth. Now he dropped lightly to the ground,
and, with the double-edged knife held firmly in
his grasp, ran swiftly toward the river.</p>

<p>Upon the banks of the stream he paused, listening.
Still the dip, dip of paddles coming upstream.
So faint and stealthy was the sound that
it would have been inaudible to most ears other
than those of Bomba.</p>

<p>The lad wasted not an instant, but slipped
from the steep bank until he was waist deep in
the sluggish water. The dense foliage of the
jungle trees grew down to the very edge of the
stream, flinging its rank growth out over the
water.</p>

<p>Bomba had a canoe of his own concealed in
the bushes some distance up the stream. Had
there been time, he would have made for that,
for he well knew the danger of making the river
crossing by fording or swimming. The deadly
alligator, or cayman, infested all the waters of the
jungle, and any daring person that ventured to
cross knew that he might pay for the venture with
his life.</p>

<p>But time was everything to Bomba now. The
headhunters were more to be feared than the
cayman. The former were awake. The latter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
might be asleep. At all costs, he must make the
venture. He must make haste, if he were to
save the life of Casson and that of Pipina.</p>

<p>Bomba had let himself go so gently into the
water as scarcely to make a ripple, and he moved
on noiselessly, wading where he could, but soon
reaching the deeper channel where he had to
swim. Then most of the time he swam under
water lest his presence be declared to prying eyes.
He was almost as much at home in the water as
on land, and only at long intervals had to come
to the surface for air.</p>

<p>But swiftly as he swam, the Indians could
paddle more swiftly. And a terrible fear gripped
the lad’s heart as the sound of the paddles grew
ever fainter in the distance.</p>

<p>They would reach the hut first. They would
find it undefended and might attack at once. The
worst might have happened before Bomba could
reach the only place he called home.</p>

<p>What he would do when he got there he had
not figured out. He would act as the occasion
suggested. He would be but one against many;
but he had been in that position more than once
and yet won the victory.</p>

<p>He swam on swiftly until he was arrested by
a sight that brought a growl of fury to his lips.</p>

<p>Turning a bend in the river, a light assailed
Bomba’s eyes, a fearful light, a light such as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
native of the jungle dreads above all others.
It was a dull glow, brightening now and then to
a vivid red as the flames swept skyward.</p>

<p>Bomba groaned and his teeth gritted against
each other as he plunged madly forward. For
he knew all too well what had caused the glare.
The hut of Pipina was ablaze!</p>

<p>This was the work of Nascanora’s bucks, their
revenge upon a broken, demented old man who
had never harmed any one in his life!</p>

<p>Was Casson in that blazing hut? Was poor
Pipina, faithful friend, caught in that flaming
inferno?</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to put these questions to himself,
Bomba swam madly upstream, his one
thought now of revenge. He was consumed by
rage. His one desire was to feel the throat of
Nascanora beneath his fingers.</p>

<p>The light was brighter now. The whole
jungle was bathed in the fiendish glow.</p>

<p>Bomba turned toward the bank, but paused
abruptly and trod water.</p>

<p>Between him and the shore, blocking his path,
was a monster alligator!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>TERRIBLE JAWS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sight of the cayman, Bomba’s heart for a
moment seemed to stop beating.</p>

<p>A wild hope that perhaps the brute was asleep
and would not perceive his presence was quickly
dispelled as the lad caught sight of two fiery
eyes fixed upon him. Then the huge mouth
opened, displaying the horrible array of teeth
that, if they once closed on the lad, would bite
him in half as easily as a pair of shears would
snip a thread.</p>

<p>Despairingly, Bomba felt for his machete. He
knew that it would avail little except perhaps to
wound. It would simply help him to die fighting.</p>

<p>Then his heart leaped. His feet felt the river
bed beneath them! He had reached the shallower
part of the stream! Now he would have a footing,
something that would give him a purchase
and enable him to use his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning, he unslung the bow from
his shoulder and drew an arrow from its quiver.
With one motion he fitted the arrow to the string
and let fly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The light from the fire gave him what he
needed for his aim, and the arrow entered the
eye of the monster and penetrated to the brain.</p>

<p>With a fearful bellow of rage and pain, the
great brute leaped half out of the water and
fell back, only to churn the water into a seething
whirlpool. In its wild flounderings the end
of its serrated tail caught Bomba on one of his
legs and threw him farther out into the stream.</p>

<p>Bomba did not mind the blow, so full of exultation
was he at the mortal wound he had inflicted
on his enemy. But his elation changed
to fear when he saw the scaly back of another
alligator breaking the water. The brute had
been attracted by the uproar created by its
stricken comrade and was coming swiftly.</p>

<p>Luckily, the bank was not far away, and, putting
all his power into his strokes, the boy swam
as he had never swum before. He reached the
shore not a moment too soon, for the hideous
jaws snapped close behind him as he pulled himself
up the bank.</p>

<p>The impulse was strong on Bomba to shoot
another arrow at the reptile and send it to join
its companion. But arrows were precious now,
and all he had would perhaps be needed for
human foes.</p>

<p>So he repressed the impulse and hurried along
the bank until he had come near the fringe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
trees that bordered the clearing in which stood
the hut. He could not yet see the hut itself.
But to reach it he would have to make a dash
across the clearing.</p>

<p>In the dark he could have eluded the eyes of
his enemies, for no snake could move more silently.
But now the open space was flooded with
light. No figures were visible, but he knew that
many eyes were watching from the surrounding
woods.</p>

<p>Still he must chance it. He had faced death
too often to let it daunt him now.</p>

<p>Summoning all his strength, he darted out into
the open. His first few bounds carried him fifty
feet. Then he dropped to the ground as a dozen
arrows whizzed over his head.</p>

<p>It was upon this that Bomba had counted. He
had timed his drop for just the instant that would
allow the startled savages to aim and let fly.</p>

<p>He was up again on his feet, and before arrows
could again be fitted to strings had gained
another fifty feet. Again he repeated his stratagem,
but this time not without scathe, for an
arrow grazed his ankle.</p>

<p>“The arrow may be poisoned,” he thought to
himself, as he felt the twinge of pain. “If it is,
this is the end of Bomba.”</p>

<p>He reached the shelter of a tree and whirled
behind it. On the side of the clearing he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
just left, one of the headhunters, keen after his
prey, had come from behind his shelter.</p>

<p>Like lightning, Bomba fitted an arrow to his
string. There was a twang, a hideous yell, and
the savage threw up his hands and fell headlong.</p>

<p>“There will be one less to fight Bomba,” muttered
the lad. “They will find that Bomba can
shoot.”</p>

<p>If any had been inclined to follow the fallen
Indian, they had hesitated when they had seen
him drop, and Bomba had a moment’s breathing
space. He flew from behind the tree and, availing
himself of what shelter he could find in his
flight, came in sight of what had been his home.</p>

<p>His heart sank within him. The cabin was a
mass of flames. It was impossible for life to be
sustained in that furnace for a minute. If Casson
and Pipina had been trapped there, they were
already far beyond human help. They must be
just what the hut itself would be in a few minutes
more, a heap of smoldering ashes.</p>

<p>For a moment Bomba forgot everything save
the agony that clutched at his heart. Then a
sound brought him back to the danger that menaced
him personally.</p>

<p>Out from the shelter of the trees, crouched
almost double, their horrible faces illumined by
the lurid light of the flames, came a number of
the headhunters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>They approached in a semicircle, cutting off
Bomba’s retreat toward the front and on either
side. Back of him was the blazing hut, the heat
from which was already scorching his face and
hands.</p>

<p>Bomba felt that he was trapped. His doom
seemed sealed. He felt for the handle of the
machete at his belt. He grasped his bow. He
would not allow himself to be taken alive. Better
instant death than the tortures of Nascanora.
And he vowed that he would take more than one
of his enemies with him.</p>

<p>He bent his bow, took quick aim and fired.
A bronze-skinned buck clapped a hand to his
breast, gave a frightful howl, and fell writhing
in the dust.</p>

<p>But before Bomba could fit another arrow to
his string there was a concerted rush and a dozen
hands reached out to seize him.</p>

<p>Bomba leaped back quickly and drew his
machete. His eyes blazed, his muscles tensed.</p>

<p>The Indians yelled and leaped forward.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>A sharp detonation clashed against their eardrums
like a crash of thunder. The force of the
explosion shook the earth and flung the natives
to the ground.</p>

<p>Bomba found himself on his face, half-stunned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
bewildered. Mysterious missiles hurtled over his
head, exploding in mid-air.</p>

<p>He raised himself cautiously to his knees and
saw a sight that brought hope to his heart.</p>

<p>The Indians were in full retreat, and as they
fled they looked over their shoulders at him fearfully,
as though they blamed him for their discomfiture.</p>

<p>Bomba well knew the mind of the Indian. The
cause of the explosion and the trembling of the
earth were unknown to them. So they reasoned
that it must be a spell thrown over them by
Bomba, friend of the old witch doctor, Casson,
to destroy them and save himself.</p>

<p>The Indians stopped in their mad flight at
the edge of the jungle and looked back. One of
them, more daring than the rest, raised his bow
and took aim.</p>

<p>But before he could release the string one of
the flying missiles struck the would-be slayer,
hurling him to the ground.</p>

<p>This was too much. The savages turned terror-stricken
and fled from that scene of mysterious
death.</p>

<p>By this time Bomba had realized what must
have caused the explosion. Their little store of
powder, so carefully guarded by Casson and himself,
had gone off when reached by the hot breath
of the fire. The flying missiles were the last of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
the cartridges belonging to his revolver, that
wonderful gift of Gillis and Dorn, the white
rubber hunters.</p>

<p>Bruised and shaken, Bomba staggered to his
feet, hardly able to believe his good fortune.</p>

<p>But as he turned back toward the cabin a
great wave of desolation flooded his heart.</p>

<p>There lay the cabin, now a heap of ashes.
Were the ashes of Casson and Pipina also there?
Had those faithful ones come there to their death?</p>

<p>With a sob Bomba threw himself on the
ground and abandoned himself to uncontrolled
grief.</p>

<p>This, however, was of short duration. A wild
rage welled up in his heart, rage against the
wicked Nascanora and his cruel tribe.</p>

<p>“They shall pay!” the lad cried, leaping to his
feet. “For every drop of Casson’s blood they
shall pay! There will yet be wailing in the huts
of Nascanora. It is I, Bomba, who swear it!”</p>

<p>He paused, head upflung, listening.</p>

<p>What was that sound?</p>

<small>HOW THE INDIANS CAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> strained his ears and again heard the
thing that had startled him. It was a faint cry,
rising and falling like a wail somewhere in the
bushes.</p>

<p>“Help!” came the voice, eerie as that of a
banshee in the darkness. “Help, Bomba!
Help!”</p>

<p>Into Bomba’s heart sprang a great joy. This
was the voice of Pipina, the squaw—the voice
that he had never expected to hear again. And
where Pipina was, must be Casson!</p>

<p>He was off like a deer in the direction from
which the cry had come.</p>

<p>“Bomba hears you,” he called softly. “Bomba
is coming.”</p>

<p>“Help!” came the feeble voice again. “Pipina
is caught and cannot get loose. Come quickly.”</p>

<p>Bomba wondered why he did not hear Casson’s
voice, if Casson still lived. But he said
nothing and hurried on, hacking a passage through
the undergrowth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>He came nearer and nearer to the wailing
woman until, pushing aside a tangle of vines, he
saw her. The moon, following close on the heels
of the tropical storm, was now riding high in
the heavens and shedding a soft luster over the
jungle. By its light, Bomba caught sight of Pipina
as she stood holding out helpless hands to
him.</p>

<p>She had been caught in a thorn thicket that
had cruelly scratched her hands and arms as she
had struggled to free herself. Her wrinkled face
was drawn with pain.</p>

<p>By the deft use of his machete Bomba cleared
away the clutching branches and released her.
The old squaw staggered dizzily, and the lad
put this arms about her shoulders to support her.</p>

<p>“Casson!” muttered Bomba hoarsely. “Tell
me, Pipina! Tell me quick! Where is Casson?”</p>

<p>The old woman drooped her head and stood
there like a bowed statue of grief, but said nothing
until Bomba, mad with anxiety, shook her
gently by the shoulders.</p>

<p>“Do you hear, Pipina? Where is the good
white man, Cody Casson, my friend?”</p>

<p>Then the old woman raised her hands above
her head and gave vent to a wailing, desolate
cry.</p>

<p>“Pipina no can tell. Casson her friend, too,
good friend. He is gone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>Bomba’s face darkened and again his heart
contracted under the cold hand of anguish.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Pipina,” he commanded. “Where
has he gone? What has become of him?”</p>

<p>“We sit down and I will tell you,” returned
the squaw. “Pipina weak, sick—”</p>

<p>For answer, Bomba cleared a space and, taking
the old woman, placed her as comfortably as he
could with her back resting against a giant tree.</p>

<p>He sat down opposite her, his arms folded, his
glance full upon her face.</p>

<p>“Now, Pipina, tell Bomba all,” he urged.</p>

<p>The old woman looked about her and shuddered.
She wrapped her skinny arms about her
as though they were a garment and had power
to ward off the chill of the night.</p>

<p>“Headhunters—they gone?” she asked fearfully.</p>

<p>“Gone,” said Bomba tersely. “Where is
Casson?”</p>

<p>“Bomba make them go away all by himself,”
continued the squaw admiringly. “Bomba great
man some day—”</p>

<p>Bomba bent toward her.</p>

<p>“Do not talk foolishly, Pipina. Bomba not
care about himself. Pipina tell about Casson.”</p>

<p>The old woman gave her wailing cry and
rocked herself back and forth drearily.</p>

<p>“We have bad time, Casson, Pipina,” she said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
“We all alone in hut, wishing Bomba come. Storm
come, but not Bomba. Thunder like roar of
pumas, many pumas.”</p>

<p>“Bomba caught in storm,” explained the lad.
“No could come till storm stopped.”</p>

<p>“Pipina listen for sound of Bomba’s feet,”
went on the squaw. “Pipina afraid. She think
danger near. Wish Bomba would come quick.”</p>

<p>She said this, leaning forward, in a quick, hissing
whisper. Now she relaxed against the tree
and stared gloomily into the heavy shadows of
the jungle.</p>

<p>“Casson not too good,” she muttered. “Pipina
worry about Casson. Worry hard.”</p>

<p>“What was wrong with Casson?” cried Bomba,
exasperated beyond measure by the slowness with
which Pipina got on with her story.</p>

<p>“He very sick,” returned the squaw. “He not
right.” She touched her forehead significantly.
“He walk back and forth, back and forth, and
talk to himself. He say: ‘Laura, Laura, dear
sweet Laura. Must tell Bomba. Bartow and
Laura and little boy—’”</p>

<p>Bomba caught the arm of the old woman in an
eager grip.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he commended. “What else did Casson
say? Tell Bomba.”</p>

<p>But Pipina shook her head.</p>

<p>“He not say more,” she said. “Only those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
words he say again and again. Then he stop,
listen at door of hut, listen and then walk up and
down, up and down.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” cried Bomba.</p>

<p>“Then we hear things. We think you come.
We happy. We sing. We dance. But no, Bomba
not come. It is the headhunters that come to
try to kill Casson and Pipina—”</p>

<p>Bomba gave a low growl like that of an animal
and ground his teeth together.</p>

<p>“They come.” The voice of the old woman
rose again in eerie wailing. “Casson, Pipina,
we close door, push bolt, as Bomba tell us. We
heap things against door. Casson he take down
old gun, but it not work. He put fire stick through
hole in hut. He think frighten bucks of Nascanora.”</p>

<p>Bomba groaned as he saw the picture of old
Cody Casson, brave to the last, defying death,
his only weapon a “fire stick” that would not
work.</p>

<p>“It happen quick,” went on Pipina with a helpless
shake of her head. “One, two, three—like
that,” with a snap of her bony fingers. “The
headhunters come. They have heads, fresh heads,
women, children heads, on string at waists.
They want more heads, Casson’s head, Pipina’s
head. They beat on door. They say: ‘Open.
No hurt. Nascanora friend of Casson.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Again came that growl as of an angry jaguar
from the clenched teeth of Bomba.</p>

<p>“Forked tongues! Black hearts!” he snarled.
The woman nodded.</p>

<p>“Casson no open door,” she resumed. “He
know Nascanora. He say things. Make big
chief mad. He beat more hard on door. He
shout: ‘Casson witch doctor. He put a spell on
sick people of our tribe. Nascanora burn Casson
and hut of Casson with him.’”</p>

<p>A smoldering fire was in Bomba’s eyes that
boded no good to the chief of the headhunters.</p>

<p>“Then Nascanora bring fire to the hut of
Pipina,” went on the squaw. “His bucks come
with heaps of vines and leaves. They wet and
not burn at first. But after they burn, burn hot,
and the hut of Pipina begin to burn too.”</p>

<p>“But you got away, Pipina!” burst in Bomba
eagerly. “You got away from the headhunters
and the fire. That was good. But how did you
do it? Tell Bomba. Do not make much words.”</p>

<p>The old woman shrugged her shoulders and
there was a touch of pride in her tone as she
replied:</p>

<p>“Beneath the hut of Pipina there is a hole, and
this hole it lead under the ground out into the
jungle.”</p>

<p>Bomba stared at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>“A hole!” he exclaimed. “A passage! Why
you not tell Bomba?”</p>

<p>The squaw smiled inscrutably.</p>

<p>“None know but Pipina.”</p>

<p>Bomba was listening with the most intense interest
and wonder.</p>

<p>“Go on,” he cried, as Pipina paused.</p>

<p>“Pipina take up board in floor of hut,” went
on the old woman. “Then get down and crawl
through hole. Casson come too. Long time to
creep through hole. Then come to end. Out into
jungle where wet and cool.”</p>

<p>“Then Casson got out safely?” cried Bomba.</p>

<p>The squaw nodded, and Bomba gratefully took
her old wrinkled hand in his.</p>

<p>“Pipina has saved the life of Casson,” the lad
said gravely. “For this Bomba thanks Pipina.
He will never forget.”</p>

<p>The old woman threw her hands above her
head, rocking herself back and forth.</p>

<p>“Ayah, ayah!” she wailed. “Pipina save the
life of Casson, but she lose him after. For when
Pipina look around Casson is gone!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>THROUGH THE JUNGLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A pang</span> like the stab of a knife went through
Bomba.</p>

<p>“What mean you, Pipina?” he cried. “Speak.
Speak fast.”</p>

<p>“We stand up from hole,” the squaw explained.
“We find us far in the jungle away from the
headhunters of Nascanora. Yet Casson and
Pipina still afraid.”</p>

<p>“You hide?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>The old woman nodded, looking about her fearfully.</p>

<p>“We go far, very far, into the jungle,” she
said. “We hide behind big rock. From there
we see light from fire. Nascanora he think we are
in hut. He think Casson and Pipina burn like
tapir meat on the end of spit. But Pipina too
smart for him. Pipina she fool the great chief
Nascanora.”</p>

<p>Her words ended in a chuckle. There was
something so ghastly in mirth at a scene that had
so many elements of tragedy that Bomba felt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
hair rise on his scalp, and he spoke sharply to
Pipina.</p>

<p>“You have not told Bomba what happened to
Casson. Do not laugh and say foolish words.
Speak wise words and few words. Tell Bomba
of Casson.”</p>

<p>“Ayah!” wailed the squaw. “I look to see the
clearing, the cabin. I look hard. I look long.
Pipina’s eyes were turned from Casson. Then
I turn and see him. Then Pipina look again at
cabin only as long as for a monkey to swing from
tree to tree. Yet when Pipina turn again—Casson
is gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone!”</p>

<p>Bomba sprang wildly to his feet and looked
about him.</p>

<p>“You do not know what way he went?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, Pipina does not know,” came sadly. “He
was gone, and Pipina did not dare go from behind
the rock for fear she be caught by the bucks
of Nascanora.”</p>

<p>“But why should Casson wander off?” asked
Bomba, in bewilderment. “He was safer behind
the rock in the company of Pipina.”</p>

<p>The old woman sighed and touched her forehead
again with her scrawny finger.</p>

<p>“He not right here,” she reminded him. “He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
not know what he do. Maybe he go to find
Bomba.”</p>

<p>“He cannot find his way anywhere,” declared
Bomba sadly. “He will be like a child in the
jungle. He will be at the mercy of the big cats,
of the anacondas, of the other creeping things
that watch and spring upon their prey. Casson
might as well have stayed in the hut of fire, for
his death in the jungle is as sure.”</p>

<p>Pipina wrung her hands and continued the rocking
motion of her body.</p>

<p>“He is mad,” she chanted in a singsong voice.
“There is a strange power about him that will
keep off evil. The gods will watch over him.
The serpent will not strike him, the jaguar will
not spring upon him. For they know that he is
mad and fear him.”</p>

<p>Though Bomba shook his head, the words of
Pipina brought a little comfort to his heart. He
knew that the savage beasts of the jungle, like
the savage men of the jungle, had fear of all that
was not sane and shunned it. Still, poor Cody
Casson’s feebleness of mind seemed but a doubtful
protection, and Bomba’s heart misgave him.</p>

<p>“When Pipina found that Casson was gone
what did she do then?” he asked, turning to
his companion.</p>

<p>“Pipina wait till fire go out and she think
Indians go away,” was the reply. “Then she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
creep back toward the cabin. She hope Bomba
come back and help her find Casson. Then the
thorns catch Pipina and she stop. She call.
Bomba come.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Bomba came—too late,” said the lad
sorrowfully. “My heart is heavy for Casson.
Except Pipina, Bomba has no other friend.”</p>

<p>“There is the good chief, Hondura,” suggested
Pipina. “He will help Bomba.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he will help,” assented Bomba wearily.
“Bomba will take Pipina to him where she may
rest in the maloca of the good chief. There she
will be safe from the headhunters of Nascanora.
Then Bomba will find Casson.”</p>

<p>But though Bomba spoke with courage, grief
possessed him. In his heart he feared that certain
death awaited the ill and feeble Casson in
the jungle.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Bomba turned to Pipina and held
out his hand to her.</p>

<p>“Come,” he said. “Bomba and Pipina will go
to the camp of Hondura. It is not safe to stay
here longer.”</p>

<p>The old woman shivered and protested.</p>

<p>“It is dark,” she complained. “Wait till the
sun rises in the sky and we shall go more quickly
to the camp of the good chief Hondura.”</p>

<p>“In this place there is danger,” returned
Bomba, in a low voice, looking uneasily about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
him. “Even now the scouts of Nascanora may
have returned to search the ashes of the cabin
to make sure that Casson and Pipina are dead.
Besides, they know that Bomba lives, and they
will not sleep well at night until they know that he,
too, is dead. Give Bomba your hand, Pipina.
We must go.”</p>

<p>Pipina obeyed without further protest. But
she was trembling with age and the damp chill of
the jungle night, and Bomba saw that their
progress to the camp of Hondura and his people
must be slow.</p>

<p>“Bomba will carry Pipina when the road is
too rough,” promised the lad. “But by the time
the sun rises in the sky we must reach the maloca
of Hondura or we are lost.”</p>

<p>The old woman hobbled on beside him, whimpering.</p>

<p>“Bomba fears nothing, but Pipina is afraid,”
she wailed. “There are evil spirits abroad in the
night. They will carry us off and bury us in the
ygapo or feed us to the hungry jaguars.”</p>

<p>“That would be better than to have the hands
of Nascanora and his bucks fall upon us,” replied
Bomba grimly. “Besides, Pipina speaks
words that are foolish. There are no evil spirits
in the darkness. The night is kind, for it hides
our going from our enemies.”</p>

<p>Bomba spoke in a very low tone, scarcely above<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
a whisper. But Pipina interrupted him, holding
up her hand.</p>

<p>“Listen!” she said. “What was that?”</p>

<p>For answer Bomba seized her by the shoulders
and dragged her down beside him. Surrounded
by the thick brush, they were well concealed from
any one who did not pass too close. There was
always a chance of being stumbled upon. But in
that event Bomba’s knife would flash with the
quickness of the rattlesnake’s spring, and its sting
would be quite as deadly.</p>

<p>Bomba listened, muscles tensed, every sense
alert. Neither he nor Pipina had been mistaken.
They had heard a sound, the sharp crackling of
a twig beneath a stealthy foot.</p>

<p>They heard no more for several seconds.
Then, not twenty feet from them, the brushwood
stirred, and from it they saw two figures emerge
and stand faintly outlined against the darker
shadows of the jungle.</p>

<p>Bomba’s first thought was that perhaps the
sound he heard had been caused by Casson. His
heart leaped with hope and gladness. But that
feeling was quickly dispelled when he recognized
two of the headhunters of Nascanora.</p>

<p>They stood there conversing in a dialect which
Bomba readily understood, as he did most other
languages of the region.</p>

<p>“They are dead,” said one of them. “The fire<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
has made ashes of their bones. The white witch
doctor will no longer lay his spells on the people
of the Giant Cataract.”</p>

<p>Bomba rejoiced. They had not then found
Casson.</p>

<p>“It is good,” returned the other. “The squaws
and the old men of the tribe will be glad when
we tell them that the man who made bad magic
is dead.”</p>

<p>“But the boy still lives,” returned the other.
“Nascanora will not sleep well until he has his
head upon his wigwam. Already this night the
boy has beaten Toluro in fight. He stamped
his head into the mud. And his arrows have carried
death on their points.”</p>

<p>“The demons help him,” the other replied.
“They come from the fire and strike down our
men. He has the same magic as the old man with
white hair. He is wiser and stronger than our
medicine men.”</p>

<p>A few more words, and the Indians passed on,
their going scarcely disturbing a leaf or a twig.</p>

<p>“They pass like the shadows of all things
evil,” murmured Bomba to himself, as he cautiously
rose again to his feet and prepared to
resume his journey. “Come, Pipina.”</p>

<p>They made fairly good progress, considering
Pipina’s age and weakness. There was no pausing
to take their bearings, for Bomba was familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
with the way that led to Hondura’s village.</p>

<p>When the strength of the old squaw failed
and she could go no farther, Bomba picked her
up in his strong young arms and carried her with
scarcely a lessening of his stride.</p>

<p>After a while they heard the sound of rushing
water.</p>

<p>Bomba lowered Pipina to the ground and stood
listening.</p>

<p>“The storm has filled the ygapo,” he murmured.
“It will be hard crossing. Listen,
Pipina.”</p>

<p>“I hear,” wailed the squaw. “Bomba cannot
ford the ygapo. He must swim, and that will be
hard with an old woman on his back. Pipina
cannot swim.”</p>

<p>“There will be caymans in the ygapo,” muttered
Bomba thoughtfully. “Bomba cannot swim
with Pipina and fight at the same time. Yet we
must cross the ygapo if we are to be in the camp
of the good chief before the sun comes up.”</p>

<p>“Pipina cannot cross,” whimpered the old
woman. “She will be killed and Bomba too will
be killed. Wait here till the darkness goes, and
we will cross by the light of the sun. Bomba
can make a raft and we will go on that.”</p>

<p>“Our enemies are about us,” returned Bomba,
as he bent a frowning look upon the surrounding
forest. “If we wait, they will find us and drag<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
us to the village of Nascanora. We cannot wait.
We must go.”</p>

<p>“The river roars,” wailed the squaw, wringing
her hands. “It waits for Bomba and Pipina like
a jaguar hungry for its meat. It is death to
cross.”</p>

<p>“A little way from here there is a log across
the water,” said Bomba. “What better bridge
do Bomba and Pipina want?”</p>

<p>“The log is slippery,” moaned Pipina. “Bomba
must go on. His feet are sure. But he cannot
carry Pipina. He will fall. Bomba go alone.
Leave Pipina behind.”</p>

<p>Ignoring the woman’s protests, Bomba caught
her in his arms and bore her swiftly along the
banks of the stream.</p>

<p>He came to the log that stretched from bank
to bank of the ygapo, or swamp. At this point
it had narrowed to the proportions of a moderately
wide gully. Usually there was only a muddy
ooze at its bottom.</p>

<p>But now the tropical rains had filled the gully,
and a raging torrent roared between the banks.</p>

<p>Bomba’s bridge would have been but a poor
one at the best of times—a tree trunk cut down
close to the bank in such a way as to fall across
the gulch.</p>

<p>Even in the light of day, to cross its moss-grown,
treacherous surface without slipping was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
no easy matter. Yet Bomba had done it again
and again, for he was as lithe and sure-footed as
a mountain goat.</p>

<p>But this was a different matter, and Bomba
was well aware of the danger that he faced.
The dashing spray had made the log almost as
slippery as glass. The darkness added to the
peril. With Pipina in his arms it would be difficult
to retain his balance. One slip and the
two might go whirling into that seething torrent
to a fate that the boy scarcely dared to think
about.</p>

<p>Still the jungle lad did not hesitate. In front
was the torrent, behind him the headhunters. He
chose what he regarded as the lesser of the two
evils, relying upon his strength and his sureness
of foot to carry him and his burden to the opposite
side.</p>

<p>He shut his ears to the menacing roar of the
waters. He had defied the fury of torrents before.
He would defy it again.</p>

<p>Resolutely Bomba set foot upon the log.</p>

<small>A PERILOUS CROSSING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Beneath</span> him the waters roared and thundered.
Pipina whimpered and besought her gods,
but the ears of Bomba were deaf to her cries.</p>

<p>Underfoot the trunk was like glass. The
slightest misstep might mean disaster. But
Bomba advanced steadily, scarcely troubled by
the light weight of the squaw. He was so accustomed
to the dark that he hardly needed the
faint rays of moonlight that filtered through the
trees to tell him where to place his feet.</p>

<p>He was half-way across. Now he was more
than half. Before him loomed the dense undergrowth
of the farther bank. Suddenly his foot
slipped!</p>

<p>For one horrible moment Bomba teetered over
eternity.</p>

<p>Pipina sent up a shrill cry, for she expected
that moment to be her last.</p>

<p>By a marvelous exercise of muscular control,
Bomba balanced himself and retained his foothold
upon the log with one foot while he drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
up the other and gradually regained his equilibrium.</p>

<p>But Pipina, in panic, was now squirming about
in his arms and disarranging his calculations.
He measured the distance still to be traversed,
staked his all on one swift run, sped across the
treacherous log, and with one last leap reached
the farther shore in safety.</p>

<p>A great joy was singing in his heart as he set
Pipina on her feet.</p>

<p>“The gods are with us, Pipina!” he exulted.
“Where are your bad spirits now? Tell Bomba
that!”</p>

<p>“We have not yet reached the maloca of Hondura,”
the old squaw reminded him, holding tenaciously
to her superstition. “It is not well to
rejoice too soon. We may yet find evil spirits
hiding, waiting for us behind the trees.”</p>

<p>But Bomba laughed such fears to scorn. He
was buoyant with confidence. Fate had been kind
to him thus far that night, fate and his own
quick brain and strong arms.</p>

<p>His knowledge of the savages and their ways
told him that he and Pipina had passed through
the ring of the headhunters. Moreover, the maloca
of Hondura was now only two hours’ journey
away and through a less tangled part of the
jungle.</p>

<p>True, there was not a moment that did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
hold possible peril for them. A boa constrictor
might dart from a tree branch and seek to encircle
them in its folds. The roar of a jaguar
might prelude its spring. Every thicket might
harbor a bringer of death.</p>

<p>But evil as they were, they were better understood
and more easily dealt with than those human
enemies, the men who carried at their belts the
heads of their victims.</p>

<p>Pipina declared now that she was strong enough
to walk, and they made rapid progress through
the jungle, and as the first faint heralds of the
dawn appeared in the eastern sky they came
within sight of the maloca, or village, of Hondura,
chief of the Araos tribe, the strongest in
that section of the jungle.</p>

<p>When Bomba and his companion reached the
outskirts of the native village they found the inhabitants
already astir. The wanderers were
challenged by scouts, for since the advent of the
headhunters a strict watch was kept day and
night. But the jungle lad was well known and
liked by the members of the tribe. His popularity
with them was only second to that of the
chief himself, for only a few months before,
Bomba had rendered the tribe a service that made
him forever secure in their affections.</p>

<p>So Bomba and Pipina were greeted with every
manifestation of delight by the sentries and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
brought in triumph into the presence of the chief.</p>

<p>The little Pirah, the greatly loved daughter
of the chief, was with her father, coaxing and
cajoling him as usual for some childish privilege.
She gave a squeal of rapture as she saw Bomba
and ran to him, flinging her arms about his neck.</p>

<p>“Bomba has come back to us!” she cried, in
delight. “Bomba will stay. That make Pirah
glad. Pirah very happy.”</p>

<p>Hondura had been watching the meeting with
a smile upon his wizened face. Now he came
forward, and his greeting, though not so demonstrative,
was quite as cordial.</p>

<p>“It is good that Bomba is here,” he said.
“Bomba has not come for many moons. Hondura
is glad. He will make a feast for Bomba
and all the tribe will rejoice.”</p>

<p>“Hondura has a good heart,” returned the lad.
“He speaks good words and his tongue is not
forked. Bomba has come to ask Hondura to
help him. He wants to leave Pipina with him
where she will be safe while he goes on a journey
that may take him many moons.”</p>

<p>“Pipina is welcome in the maloca of Hondura,”
replied the chief, as he turned a kindly look on
the old woman, who bowed her head and stood
in meek humility before him. “Pipina can stay
with the women because she is a friend of Bomba,
who is a good friend to the tribe of Hondura.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>The chief motioned them to seat themselves
upon the cushions of rushes within his tepee, and
presently food was brought to them which they
devoured eagerly, for they had not eaten since
noon of the day before.</p>

<p>While they ate, Hondura questioned them
further, while Pirah sat close to the jungle lad,
every now and then reaching out a timid little
hand to touch him.</p>

<p>“Where is the good white man, Casson?” asked
Hondura.</p>

<p>Bomba shook his head sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Casson has gone away,” he replied. “He
has wandered into the jungle. The headhunters
came last night and burned the cabin of Pipina.
Bomba was not there. But when he came he
found Pipina hiding. She did not know where
Casson had gone.”</p>

<p>Fire flashed in Hondura’s eyes.</p>

<p>“May the curse of the gods rest on Nascanora,”
he cried. “Bomba should have killed him the
night he had him at his mercy.”</p>

<p>The reference was to a happening that had
taken place near the Giant Cataract on a night
that Bomba had met Nascanora in the midst of
a perilous and horrifying scene. As the chief had
blocked his path Bomba had sunk the iron hilt
of his machete into Nascanora’s face, knocking
him senseless. Hondura had urged then that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
Bomba slay Nascanora, but the boy had refused
to kill an enemy who could not fight.</p>

<p>“The point of your knife should have bit into
his heart,” went on Hondura. “Then he would
have troubled you no more. Now he hates you
more than before and has sworn to have vengeance.
His nose is crushed, and the squaws laugh
at him behind his back, though they do not dare
to smile where he can see them. He would die
happy if he could make Bomba die first.”</p>

<p>Bomba laughed.</p>

<p>“He has yet to catch Bomba,” he replied. “And
if he does catch him, he may wish that he had
rather laid his hand upon a cooanaradi. I do
not fear Nascanora. But I fear for Casson.”</p>

<p>“Hondura is sorry that the good old white
man has gone,” said the chief gravely. “Hondura
like Casson. All the Araos like him. Wish
him good.”</p>

<p>“The good spirits will be with him in the
jungle,” put in little Pirah. “They will bring him
safely to Bomba again or to one of the bucks of
my father.”</p>

<p>Hondura smiled indulgently upon the child and
put a hand upon the dark hair.</p>

<p>“Pirah speaks well,” he remarked. “May the
good spirits be with Casson during his journeyings
in the jungle.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>Bomba thanked them both from his heart and
addressed himself to the chief.</p>

<p>“If the good chief meets the white man, Casson,
will he bring him to his maloca and keep
him safe until Bomba comes back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“That Hondura will do,” promised the chief
gravely.</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence, while
each stared thoughtfully into the jungle. Then
Hondura asked:</p>

<p>“Where does Bomba go now that he speaks
of leaving the maloca of Hondura?”</p>

<p>“I shall not leave yet, Hondura,” he replied.
“First, I shall search for Casson. I will beat
every thicket of the jungle until I find him or
feel sure that the gods have taken him. Only
after that is done will Bomba set out on a long
journey.”</p>

<p>“The words are dark yet,” replied the chief.
“Where is Bomba going?”</p>

<p>“Bomba still seeks his parents,” returned the
lad. “He wants to know about his father and
his mother. Even the jaguar’s cubs know their
father and mother. Bomba does not know. His
heart will be heavy till he does know. He has
tried to learn the truth for many moons. He has
gone to the land of the Giant Cataract. He has
traveled to the Moving Mountain. He has gone
to the snake island of Sobrinini. He has journeyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
many miles and met many dangers, and he
does not yet know the truth.”</p>

<p>“Where does Bomba go now to find the truth?”
asked the chief, his eyes dwelling thoughtfully on
the lad.</p>

<p>“I go to seek Japazy, the half-breed,” replied
Bomba. “Japazy may tell Bomba what he
wishes to know. Jojasta is gone. Sobrinini is
gone. Casson is gone. Japazy is the one hope
of Bomba. If Japazy is dead—”</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence, but with a
shrug of his shoulder stared gloomily before him.</p>

<p>There was an interval of silence, and when the
chief spoke again it was in a low and solemn
tone.</p>

<p>“Where is it,” he asked, “that Bomba would
seek for Japazy, the half-breed?”</p>

<p>Bomba hesitated for a moment, then spoke:</p>

<p>“I go to a spot where it is said I may find
Japazy. I go to Jaguar Island.”</p>

<p>The stoic calm of the Indian vanished. A look
of horror sprang into his eyes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br>

<small>THE WARNING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> chief of the Araos leaned toward Bomba
and spoke in a voice charged with intensity:</p>

<p>“Hondura is a friend of Bomba. Hondura
speaks wise words. If Bomba is wise, he will
stay in the maloca of Hondura and not go to the
island of the big cats.”</p>

<p>Bomba looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why does Hondura tell this to Bomba?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“Because Hondura is friend of Bomba,” replied
the chief gravely. “He would not see
Bomba put his head within the jaws of death.”</p>

<p>“Is it because it is called Jaguar Island?” persisted
the lad. “Is it the big cats Hondura
fears?”</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>“The danger Hondura fears for Bomba,” he
answered impressively, “is not of this world. It
is of the world beyond. Be warned in time,
Bomba. Hondura has spoken.”</p>

<p>Although Bomba had been taught by Casson to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
laugh at the superstitions of the natives, he had
lived his life too far from civilization not to
share to some extent their primitive fear of the
supernatural.</p>

<p>The words of Hondura sent a strange chill
through him. What did the Indian mean?</p>

<p>“Of what danger speak you, Hondura?” he
asked in an awed voice. “Tell Bomba, so that
he may know the truth.”</p>

<p>“Once a great many moons ago,” began Hondura,
“there was above the island of the great
cats a big, strange city.”</p>

<p>The eyes of Bomba glistened.</p>

<p>“Tell me of it!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Those that knew of it said it was a city of
devils, though its beauty was that of the sun.”</p>

<p>“What made its beauty like the sun?” was
Bomba’s eager query.</p>

<p>“The towers,” replied Hondura, “were of gold
and reached upward like trees to the sky. When
men looked upon them long they had to cover
their eyes with their hands. Else they would have
gone blind.”</p>

<p>“I wish that the eyes of Bomba might have seen
it, Hondura!” exclaimed the lad. He thought
longingly of those faraway cities described to him
by the boy named Frank, the white boy, son of
the woman with the golden hair, who had once
kissed Bomba as though he had been her son.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Perhaps this city with towers of gold was like
those others. So he looked eagerly, yearningly,
at the wrinkled face of the grizzled chieftain
who spoke with such a calm air of assurance.</p>

<p>“It is many moons since the eyes of men have
rested upon that city,” returned the Indian sternly,
seeming by his manner to rebuke the boy’s enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Bomba was abashed, but asked with undiminished
curiosity:</p>

<p>“What then became of the city of gold, Hondura?
Tell Bomba so that he may know the
truth. His heart is thirsty like that of the tapir
that bends its head toward the cool water.”</p>

<p>“The city sank into the earth,” returned Hondura.
“Slowly the mud of the swamp crept up
over it and the towers of gold were covered so
that they no more made blind the eyes of men.”</p>

<p>The chief seemed to sink into a reverie after
this announcement, and Bomba ventured to remind
him of his presence by asking another question.</p>

<p>“The city is gone. Where then is the danger
to Bomba, O good and wise chief?”</p>

<p>Hondura roused himself from his abstraction
and stared at Bomba almost as though he were
looking through him to something sinister that
lay beyond.</p>

<p>“It is true that the city is gone. But strange
ghosts arise from it, spirits that harm.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>The little Pirah cried out sharply, and Pipina
started a long eerie wail that chilled Bomba to
the marrow of his bones.</p>

<p>“The evil spirits walk abroad at night,” the
chief continued, “and woe is the portion of those
who meet them. For they carry with them pain
and pestilence and death. Of those who have
met them in the darkness of the night none have
come back alive.”</p>

<p>Bomba was impressed despite himself. Nevertheless
his determination remained unshaken.</p>

<p>“The cause of Bomba is a good one,” he said
simply. “Bomba does not fear the evil spirits.”</p>

<p>“Hondura knows that Bomba does not fear
anything living,” the chief responded. “But he
has no arrow that will sink into the breasts of the
dead. He has no knife that can reach their
hearts. They will not fear when Bomba defies
them. They will laugh.”</p>

<p>“I am going,” the lad declared.</p>

<p>The old chief nodded his head as though, knowing
Bomba, he had expected some such answer
from the boy.</p>

<p>“Go then. But go only to the island of the
big cats. Do not go to the place above the
island where the city with the towers of gold
stood. Find Japazy, the half-breed, and return
with speed. Hondura and the little Pirah will
watch for you. And we will have prayers made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
by the medicine man that you do not meet the
evil spirits.”</p>

<p>“But do not go yet,” pleaded Pirah, clinging to
his hand. “Pirah wants you to stay days, many
days. You are tired. You have been fighting.
We will make big feast if you will stay in the
maloca of Hondura for a time.”</p>

<p>Bomba returned the pressure of the warm little
hand affectionately.</p>

<p>“Pirah is good and Hondura too is good,” he
said earnestly. “Bomba would be glad to stay.
But he must go.”</p>

<p>He turned to the chief.</p>

<p>“I go first into the jungle to hunt for Casson,”
he said. “I will look for him till I find him or
feel sure that he is dead. If I find him, I will
bring him back to stay with Hondura. If I do
not find him, I will go on to find Japazy on Jaguar
Island.”</p>

<p>Pipina set up a wail, but Bomba checked her.</p>

<p>“Do not cry, Pipina,” he said. “Bomba has
many times gone into the jungle and come back
again. Did he not go to the Moving Mountain
and return? Did he not come back from the
Giant Cataract and the island of snakes? The
gods will watch over me, and you can stay here
safe with the women of Hondura’s tribe and help
them with their cooking and their weaving. And
you can tell them of the hole in the floor and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
you were wiser than all the warriors of Nascanora.”</p>

<p>The last was cunningly put, and the look of
pride that came into the old woman’s eyes showed
that if the Araos women failed to appreciate her
strategy it would not be for lack of telling.</p>

<p>Bomba turned to the chief.</p>

<p>“Your heart is big, Hondura, and your heart is
good,” he said. “Bomba will not forget.”</p>

<p>“It is but little that Hondura is doing for
Bomba,” the old chieftain replied. “Did not
Bomba save my people? Did he not bring back
the women and little children that Nascanora’s
bucks had stolen? My people would die for
Bomba. And I will tell my braves to hunt for
Casson. Wherever they go their eyes will be
open for the old white man. They will be looking
while Bomba is on his way to Jaguar Island.
And if he is alive, they will find him.”</p>

<p>The assurance was an immense comfort to the
heart of Bomba. If his own search for Casson
failed, he would know that a host of sharp eyes
were taking up his work. All that could be done
would be done for the old man he loved.</p>

<p>He stayed at the maloca only long enough to
get some more strings for his bow and to replenish
his stock of arrows and put an additional
edge on his machete. Then, with a warm farewell
to Hondura, Pirah, Pipina, and the assembled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
people of the tribe, he plunged into the jungle.</p>

<p>He thought longingly of the “fire stick” and the
cartridges that had been destroyed in the blazing
cabin. He took the now useless revolver
from his pouch where he carried it in a waterproof
covering and looked at it sadly. It was a
fine weapon, and he had learned to use it effectively,
though not yet with the perfect accuracy
of the machete and the bow and arrows.</p>

<p>“The fire stick might not hurt the ghosts from
the sunken city,” he pondered, as he turned the
revolver lovingly in his hands; “but against the
beasts of the jungle and the braves of Nascanora
it speaks with the voice of death. And who
knows but what it might save my life when I
reach the place of the big cats.”</p>

<p>Again his anger flamed against the headhunters.</p>

<p>“They may still, by robbing me of my cartridges,
be the cause of my death,” he murmured.</p>

<p>But he had the fatalistic philosophy born of
his life in the jungle. The cartridges were gone.
He could not help it. Perhaps it had been decreed.
Who was he, Bomba, to find fault with
the laws that governed the world?</p>

<p>For all the rest of that day he hunted feverishly
for some trace of Casson. Hardly a foot
of ground escaped his eager scrutiny. He searched
every thicket, explored every swamp. At times,
when he felt it was safe, he raised his voice in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the hope that perhaps Casson might hear him.
But all his efforts were fruitless. There was no
trace or sound of his half-demented protector.</p>

<p>During his search he had gathered some turtle
eggs, and these he roasted at night over a fire
before the opening of a cave that he had chosen
for the night’s shelter.</p>

<p>The food was succulent, the fire comforting,
and the cave reasonably safe. Bomba built up
the fire so that it should serve through the night
to keep off the prowling denizens of the forest,
and made his refuge secure by rolling a great
stone that no animal could dislodge to the entrance
of the cave.</p>

<p>Then he lay down and slept, not opening his
tired eyes till the first break of dawn.</p>

<p>All that day and the next Bomba hunted for
Cody Casson. He had given himself three days
before he would relinquish the quest as hopeless.</p>

<p>Occasionally he came upon traces of the headhunters.
But the tracks were cold, and Bomba
calculated that they were at least five days old.
If the bucks were in that region at all, they were
probably lurking in the vicinity of the cabin,
where, soon or late, they could count on Bomba’s
reappearance.</p>

<p>Toward the evening of the third day Bomba
caught sight of something strange lying at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
roots of a great tree in one of the most extensive
swamps with which the region abounded.</p>

<p>At first sight it looked like a crumpled heap of
rags. Bomba’s thought was that it was the remains
of an old hammock or native rug thrown
aside as useless.</p>

<p>But there was something in the shape of it that
made him revise his opinion, and he approached
it with the caution that he always used when in
the presence of something which he did not understand.</p>

<p>When at last he stood beside it he started back
with a gasp.</p>

<p>It was a skeleton that lay there amid the shreds
of garments that had previously clothed the body!</p>

<p>Bomba had seen such grisly sights before.
They were not uncommon in the jungle, where
natives without number met their end by the
jaws of the puma and the fangs of the snake.</p>

<p>No, it was not the mere sight of a skeleton
that made Bomba start so violently.</p>

<p>It was the fact that <i>the skeleton was that of a
white man</i>!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE SKELETON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> knew at once that the poor remnant of
humanity that lay before him was not that of a
native of the country.</p>

<p>He knew it by the character of the hair that
still adhered to the scalp, by the fragments of
skin that still were in evidence.</p>

<p>And he knew by the clothes, which, though tattered
into shreds, were similar to those that had
been worn by Gillis and Dorn, by the men of the
Parkhurst family. They were of heavy khaki
cut after the civilized fashion.</p>

<p>Some hunter, no doubt; a hunter after big
game or a hunter of rubber trees, who had come
into the dark recesses of the Amazonian jungle.</p>

<p>Various signs indicated that the body had been
there for some time. How the man had died
would never be known. Somewhere in the civilized
world he was marked down as “missing.”
The jungle kept its secrets well.</p>

<p>Bomba stood looking down at the skeleton
with a strange feeling in his heart. This man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
had been white! He had been a brother to
Bomba, of the same blood, of the same race!
A sense of kinship tugged at the lad’s heart.</p>

<p>And because he had been white, Bomba determined
that the poor remains should have decent
burial. He sought out a suitable piece of wood
and with his machete fashioned a rude spade.
With this he set to work and soon had dug a
grave in the soft and muddy ground.</p>

<p>He lifted the skeleton reverently and bore it
to the grave. As he did so, something dropped
with a metallic sound. He paid no attention to
this at the moment, but bestowed the bones carefully
in the grave. Then he covered it and rolled
great stones over the top that the last resting
place of the stranger might be undisturbed.</p>

<p>He knew little of prayer. He had seen, to
be sure, the incantations that the medicine men
made to their gods. But something confused and
vague shaped itself in his mind, an unspoken request
that all might be well with the white man,
wherever his spirit might be. For was not the
white man Bomba’s brother?</p>

<p>He was turning away when his eye caught
sight of the something that he had heard drop to
the ground. He looked at it indifferently for a
moment and then he pounced upon it eagerly.</p>

<p>It was a belt of cartridges!</p>

<p>He handled the objects with a delight beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
all bounds. It was like a gift from the gods.
With a trembling hand he took his revolver from
its pouch. The cartridges fitted perfectly!</p>

<p>Bomba was in a frenzy of rapture. He wanted
to shout, to dance, to sing. Now he had another
effective weapon, a formidable addition to his
machete and his bow and arrows.</p>

<p>“I gave the white man burial, and he has given
me these,” he said to himself. “He knew that
Bomba, too, was white! He knew that Bomba
was his brother!”</p>

<p>Where there were cartridges there were likely
to be weapons, and Bomba scanned the surrounding
spaces carefully. But neither rifle nor revolver
was to be seen. Bomba conjectured that
natives, passing, might have found and appropriated
these as curiosities, though they did not
know how to use them. The fact that the cartridge
belt had not been disturbed was probably
due to a superstitious repugnance to touch a dead
body for fear it would bring evil fortune.</p>

<p>It was with a vastly increased confidence that
Bomba at last betook himself from the scene.</p>

<p>His steps now turned toward a trail about
which he had learned from the caboclos of the
district, a trail that after long journeying would
lead him to the river and to Jaguar Island, where
Japazy dwelt.</p>

<p>If Bomba could find and keep to this trail, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
would lead him more quickly to his destination
and lessen the danger of his becoming lost in a
section of the jungle into which he had not yet
penetrated.</p>

<p>It was two days later that Bomba came upon
the trail he sought. He recognized it with a feeling
of joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p>“Bomba is sure now of finding the way to
Jaguar Island,” he told himself. “If Japazy is
there, all may be well. If not, Bomba will have
his long journey for nothing.”</p>

<p>As he struck out along the trail the lad was
seized by a desire for speed that was almost panic.
Again and again the thought came to him, giving
new stimulus to his steps:</p>

<p>“I may be an hour too late. I may be only
a minute too late. If I reach the island and find
Japazy gone, what then? He is Bomba’s one
hope. Without the knowledge Japazy has,
Bomba is doomed to live in the jungle forever.
Bomba will never know about Bartow and Laura
and the boy they called Bonny. Bomba must put
wings to his feet.”</p>

<p>All that day he flogged himself along with this
thought, stopping only to tear off and eat a strip
of the tapir meat that he had brought with him
from the village of Hondura.</p>

<p>Bomba could not go without food, but he could
go without sleep, or at least do with very little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>But exhausted nature took its toll after he had
traveled through the long hours of the night and
faced a gray-streaked dawn, spent and haggard-eyed.</p>

<p>Sleep weighted his eyelids, dragged at his feet.
Bomba lay down and slept.</p>

<p>In his sleep he dreamed. It was a terrible
dream, and in it he was back again in the heart
of the Moving Mountain. Flames licked at him
hungrily, strange grumblings and roarings resounded
about him, and yet he could make no
move to escape.</p>

<p>With a mighty gasping effort, Bomba heaved
his body beyond the reach of the fire—and opened
his eyes!</p>

<p>Instantly he was wide awake. Night had crept
upon him while he slept, and now upon the wings
of darkness rode a fearful storm filling the jungle
with wailings and thunderings.</p>

<p>Bomba leaped to his feet and looked about him.</p>

<p>“I have slept the day away!” was his first angry
thought. “If Bomba does not find Japazy it will
be his own fault!”</p>

<p>But this consideration was soon swept aside by
the realization of his own immediate peril.</p>

<p>With every moment the storm increased in
fury. So far, it had been wind and thunder and
lightning, but no rain. Now the heavens opened
and the rain descended in blinding torrents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>Bomba was at a loss as to where to fly for
shelter. His surroundings were strange to him.
He had slept in a thorn thicket that had protected
him from the inroad of wild beasts, but now
offered little refuge from the storm. He knew
of no cave or native hut in the immediate vicinity.</p>

<p>While he hesitated, there was a rending crash
above his head.</p>

<p>He leaped back, but not in time. A tree, as
though uprooted by a giant’s hand, crashed to
the ground, bearing all before it.</p>

<p>Bomba felt himself flung through the air, was
conscious of a piercing pain in the back of his
head, and then for a time knew nothing.</p>

<p>How long he lay pinioned beneath the branches
of the tree, Bomba did not know. But when he
woke again to a knowledge of his surroundings
he found that the storm still raged through the
jungle. His head ached fiercely and he felt dizzy
and sick.</p>

<p>His head was resting in something sticky and
soft. Bomba thought at first that it might be
blood from his head, for he remembered a terrific
blow as he fell.</p>

<p>Both hands were imprisoned by the branches,
but after considerable effort he managed to free
one of them. This he moved cautiously about to
the back of his head. There was a bump on it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
big as an egg, but he could discover no gash in the
scalp.</p>

<p>His head then was not lying in a pool of blood.
It was imbedded in the thick oozy mud of a
swamp.</p>

<p>By a great strain he lifted his head a trifle
and heard the thick suck of the ooze as it reluctantly
released its prey.</p>

<p>Then did Bomba’s heart almost misgive him.
He could reconstruct now what had happened.
The outflung branches of the tree had swept him
over the border of the treacherous ygapo near
which he had been sleeping.</p>

<p>He lay now, half upon solid ground and half
in the swamp. The branches of the tree pinioned
the lower part of his body, but his head and shoulders
rested in the thick muck. Then, with a thrill
of horror, he realized that he was sinking deeper.
He knew how readily the ygapo engulfed anything
that ventured upon it.</p>

<p>Had his whole body lain in the ooze and had
his unconsciousness persisted much longer, he
would already have been in so deep that to extricate
himself would have been impossible. But
the solid ground beneath the lower part of his
body gave him a certain purchase, and he strained
to the utmost to raise his head and shoulders so as
to make their weight as light as possible.</p>

<p>His plight was desperate. The branches of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
tree reached to his shoulders. He could manage
to use only his left hand and arm, for the right
one seemed to be numb. It had no sense of feeling.
Bomba knew that it must have received a
hard blow, perhaps be broken.</p>

<p>With the free use of his machete he might have
hacked a way through to freedom, although even
with the aid of the knife it would have been a
slow and painful process.</p>

<p>But the machete was in his belt near that right
hand that had no sense of feeling. To get at it
with his left he would first have to break away
the branches that pressed so heavily upon his
chest. And to do this with his bare hands seemed
impossible.</p>

<p>Bomba tried to hold his head above the ooze,
raising it by the sheer strength of his shoulders
until the straining muscles could no longer bear
the weight. And when, groaning, he let his head
sink back, the mud sucked at it gloatingly.</p>

<p>“This, then, is the end of Bomba,” the lad muttered
to himself gloomily. “He would have liked
to die on his feet, fighting. But he must die here
alone like any trapped beast of the jungle.”</p>

<p>The jungle! There lay the nub of his bitterness.
Why should he be in the jungle, he a white
boy, whose rightful heritage of a life with his
own kind had been denied him by a cruel fate?
Why did he not have a home like that of Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Parkhurst, a father who was proud of him, a
mother who loved him? Why had he been fated
to have his life placed every day in jeopardy? He
had been cheated of what belonged to him equally
with every other boy of the white race.</p>

<p>“I shall never see Casson now, if he be still
alive,” he murmured. “Japazy, the half-breed,
will die with the secret that I seek still hidden in
his heart.”</p>

<p>Then his anger at fate turned against himself.</p>

<p>“Bomba was a fool to sleep,” he gritted
through his clenched teeth. “If he had been
awake, he would have seen the storm approaching
and would have found some cave or overhanging
rock for shelter. Bomba is a fool and
deserves to die.”</p>

<p>He began tearing at the branches with his one
free hand, though he knew he could not lift that
weight from his chest. He lifted his head and
tried to reach the twigs with his teeth. He was
half mad with rage and black despair.</p>

<p>Then, in a turning of his head, he saw a sight
that chilled his blood. His body became instantly
as rigid as stone.</p>

<p>Not ten feet from him he saw a mass of coils
that he recognized from the markings as that of
the Brazilian rattlesnake, the jararaca.</p>

<p>The mass lay almost motionless and, except
for an occasional slight heaving as from breathing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the reptile might have seemed dead. The
head was not visible.</p>

<p>Was it sleeping? Or had it perhaps been
wounded, swept to that place as Bomba had been
by the branches of the tree?</p>

<p>If the reptile were sleeping, any movement of
Bomba’s might wake it. Even if it were wounded,
it would certainly make an effort to destroy the
lad if it should discover him.</p>

<p>It seemed only a matter of dying in one way
or another. Either the snake or the swamp would
bring him death. In either case his death would
be a horrible one.</p>

<p>Oh, if he were only on his feet, machete in
hand!</p>

<p>There was a movement of the sluggish coils.
Bomba watched them with a horrid fascination,
scarcely daring to breathe.</p>

<p>Gradually the coils unwound. The hideous triangular
head came in sight. The reptile looked
slowly about as though deciding which way to go.</p>

<p>Then the snake saw Bomba!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>WRITHING COILS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> saw the malignant fury that came into
the snake’s eyes. He knew that the reptile had
seen him, and over the boy’s face, like a pallid
cloak, spread the calmness of despair.</p>

<p>This then was the end! He might live perhaps
ten, fifteen, possibly twenty minutes after the poison
fangs had sunk into his flesh, and they would
be minutes of such intolerable agony that death,
when it came, would be welcomed as a friend.</p>

<p>The snake uncoiled and crawled swiftly toward
Bomba until it came within striking distance.
Then it threw itself into a coil and reared its head.</p>

<p>Bomba saw that head, those open jaws dripping
poison, closed his eyes and waited for death.</p>

<p>But even while he waited, something swished
past his head, coming from the tree above.</p>

<p>It was a castanha nut, one of those huge, heavy
nuts that, falling on a man’s head, may fracture
his skull.</p>

<p>The missile, flung with deadly aim, hit the head
of the rattlesnake, crushing it into pulp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>Bomba opened his eyes as the coils of the dead
snake writhed and lashed about his head.</p>

<p>By some miracle the enemy had been vanquished.
Was it the storm that had loosened the
great nut which was almost as large as Bomba’s
head? If so, it was perhaps a sign from the gods
of the Indians that Bomba was not to die until
his work should be accomplished.</p>

<p>But his first joy at his deliverance was quickly
followed by apprehension and the realization that
he might still be in the shadow of death. He had
escaped the fangs of the serpent. But who or
what could rescue him from the greedy clutch of
the swamp?</p>

<p>As though in answer to the thought, something
dropped from the tree beside him.</p>

<p>What was this? A new enemy?</p>

<p>Bomba lay very still as the shape came toward
him. Whether it was man or beast he could not
tell, for there was no word from the one or growl
from the other.</p>

<p>Then a hairy paw was laid upon his arm, and
Bomba thrilled with a new hope. He knew the
touch of that paw, knew that at last he had met
a friend.</p>

<p>“Doto!” he cried. “Good Doto! So you have
come to Bomba. And Bomba never needed you
more.”</p>

<p>The friendly monkey, almost the size of Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
himself, pressed close to Bomba’s side and chattered
delightedly. For he was one of the chief
animal friends that Bomba had made in the jungle.
Bomba had once saved Doto’s life, and more
than once since then Doto had been of great service
to Bomba in warning him of enemies.</p>

<p>Bomba was exceedingly fond of the big monkey,
and now he stroked the hairy arm and head
affectionately.</p>

<p>“Once more Doto has saved the life of
Bomba,” the lad said. “Bomba is grateful.”</p>

<p>The monkey pressed against him, answering
in a language Bomba had come to understand.
But suddenly Doto sprang to his feet, looking
about him excitedly. He began to jabber wildly,
and Bomba knew that he scented danger of some
kind.</p>

<p>Perhaps some wild beast was approaching.
Perhaps the headhunters were creeping upon
them.</p>

<p>“Doto wants Bomba to be free?” asked
Bomba, and the monkey broke into a chatter of
assent. “Then Doto must help Bomba,” and the
lad pointed to the mass of branches that held
him prisoner.</p>

<p>“Doto break branches so that Bomba can get
knife that is at his belt,” directed the jungle boy.</p>

<p>The monkey appeared to understand and set to
work at once, breaking off the smaller branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
and bending the larger ones so that he could
reach beneath them.</p>

<p>The storm was clearing away. The rain had
almost stopped, the wind blew in fitful gusts.
Bomba stared up at the sky while hope once more
flowed like a warm flood into his heart.</p>

<p>“The machete, Doto!” he cried. “Get the big
knife of Bomba!”</p>

<p>He had often showed the knife to Doto in
their conferences in the forest and boasted of its
power. Doto knew what Bomba meant when he
spoke of the machete, and he knew also that
Bomba carried it at his belt. He reached his
furry paw beneath the branches and drew forth
the weapon.</p>

<p>Bomba gave a cry of delight as his hand once
more closed on the haft of his faithful machete.</p>

<p>“Good Doto!” he exclaimed. “Bomba has his
big knife. All is well again.”</p>

<p>The task of cutting away the imprisoning
branches was a laborious one, flat upon his back
as he was and having only the use of his left
hand.</p>

<p>But it was the faithful Doto who lifted the
boy’s head from the ooze and supported his
shoulder so that he could do the work more
easily.</p>

<p>Gradually the bonds across his chest relaxed
their grip. Doto raised him higher and higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
until he had reached a sitting position. Then the
work went on apace.</p>

<p>Bomba tried to move his right arm but found
that there was still no feeling in it. He did not
spend any time over it, but went on hacking away
with his left hand.</p>

<p>He grew tired and paused at times to rest, but
it was always Doto that urged him on to fresh
effort. That the monkey scented danger, Bomba
knew, and yet, listen as he would, he could hear
no sound that had menace in it.</p>

<p>Still he trusted the instinct of the monkey. The
ears of Bomba were keen, but those of Doto were
keener still.</p>

<p>So he forced himself to labor when his muscles
were crying out urgently for rest. Gradually the
weight upon his legs lifted. He found that he
could move one of them, then the other.</p>

<p>“Bomba thinks he can get out now, if Doto will
help,” said the lad.</p>

<p>He placed the monkey’s paws beneath his
shoulders and signified that it was to pull with all
its strength.</p>

<p>This Doto did, and Bomba ground his teeth
with pain as he was at last drawn clear of the
branches.</p>

<p>With difficulty he stood upon his feet, leaning
heavily against Doto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>He was stiff and sore in every muscle. It was
agony even to draw a deep breath.</p>

<p>Still, the heart of the lad swelled with exultation
and a new sense of power. He stood upright,
his machete was at his side; his bow was
still intact, his quiver full of arrows, and in his
pouch was his greatly prized revolver, once again
fully loaded.</p>

<p>He felt of his right arm and found that it was
unbroken. There was a numbness in it that gave
place to pain as the blood began to pulse strongly
through it, but Bomba knew that in a short time
it would be as well as ever.</p>

<p>“The bones of Bomba bend but they do not
break,” the lad exulted.</p>

<p>But Doto’s anxiety was still unabated. His
uneasiness increased with every moment, and he
pressed closely against Bomba, urging him to
leave the spot.</p>

<p>Bomba tried a few steps and found that he
could walk, though waveringly. So he motioned
to the monkey to go ahead and lead the way.</p>

<p>This Doto did with great alacrity, pausing
when his pace became too swift for Bomba and
waiting till the boy caught up with him.</p>

<p>Thus they traveled for a considerable distance
through the jungle. The storm had worn itself
out. The treetops were still agitated by occasional
sharp gusts of wind, but where Bomba and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
Doto sped along the jungle lay in an almost deathlike
hush.</p>

<p>“Where is it that Doto takes Bomba?” asked
the lad, easing his bruised muscles as he paused
to rest. “We must not go too far from the trail,
for Bomba must press on to the island of the big
cats where lives Japazy, the half-breed.”</p>

<p>For answer Doto broke into a frantic chattering
and pulled the boy along by the arm.</p>

<p>Suddenly the eyes of Bomba narrowed and he
pressed a hand over the monkey’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he commanded sharply. “Bomba has
heard something in the jungle.”</p>

<p>The monkey’s chatter ceased, and behind him
in the darkness Bomba heard the faint sound of
padding feet.</p>

<p>He listened and heard it again, but not in the
same place. Again the faint pad, pad of feet
moving stealthily, but this time more to the east.</p>

<p>Once more that ominous sound. This time to
the north.</p>

<p>Bomba knew that sound. He knew the smell
that came to his keen nostrils.</p>

<p>Pumas! Three of them at least. They were
stalking him, moving in a semicircle, closing in
upon him!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE TRAILING PUMAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Against</span> one puma, despite its terrible teeth
and claws, Bomba would have had a fair chance
of success in warding off an attack. His arrow
might reach its heart before it could spring.</p>

<p>But if three attacked at once, he would have
no chance at all. He and Doto must reach some
place of safety quickly, or they were lost.</p>

<p>Doto was tugging frantically at his arm, and
Bomba broke into a quick pantherlike run. But
the pumas quickened their pace also, instinct telling
them that their intended surprise had failed.
There was the breaking of brushwood all about
as the great beasts burst through.</p>

<p>With Doto still clutching his arm, Bomba and
the monkey plunged together into a dark and
narrow passage.</p>

<p>Even as they rushed within the cave, the pumas
sprang to the attack.</p>

<p>But two of them, in making for the hole
through which their prey threatened to escape,
collided with a thud of heavy bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>The entrance was too narrow for both, and
their heads were jammed together.</p>

<p>They pulled back, snapping and snarling, and
in a second were engaged in deadly combat.</p>

<p>The diversion seemed to give Bomba the
chance that he wanted. He slipped the bow from
his shoulder and drew an arrow from his quiver.</p>

<p>But the implement must have been injured in
the fall of the tree, for as Bomba drew it taut
the frayed string broke with an ominous snap.</p>

<p>Bomba threw the bow aside with an exclamation
of anger. Then he drew his revolver from
its pouch and, reaching for his machete, held it
in his left hand.</p>

<p>With either he could wound, perhaps kill, one
of his enemies. But he was still uncertain but
what the others would have to be reckoned with,
and, in that case, he knew how slim his chances
were of coming through the fight alive.</p>

<p>The two pumas still fought, however, locked in
a deadly embrace that would probably mean
death for one of them, perhaps both. In their
struggle they had rolled a short distance from the
mouth of the cave, and Bomba could hear them
thrashing about in the brushwood.</p>

<p>But where was the third puma?</p>

<p>Then Bomba felt rather than heard the stealthy
approach of the great brute.</p>

<p>Two yellow glints appeared before the mouth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
of the cave. Two glaring, sinister eyes peered in.
Bomba shrank back into the darkness and his
grip tightened about his weapons.</p>

<p>But as he waited, braced for the attack, he
felt a sharp pull on his arm. It came from Doto,
who was chattering wildly.</p>

<p>Bomba tried to shake off the paw.</p>

<p>“Do not hinder Bomba, Doto,” he hissed
through his set teeth. “Bomba fights for his life.”</p>

<p>But Doto persisted, and by main strength drew
Bomba back, took the boy’s hand, and laid it upon
something that was cold to the touch. Instantly
Bomba grasped the monkey’s meaning.</p>

<p>Here was a rock, a great rock, set not far from
the entrance. If they could roll it across that
gaping opening, their lives might yet be saved.</p>

<p>The fierce snarling of the fighting pumas came
to them from the dense shadow of the underbrush.
They were busy doing Bomba’s work for
him. Far more fearsome at the moment was that
huge figure at the mouth of the cave.</p>

<p>The third puma was cautious. The hole was
black. The man creature would be armed with
things that stung. The beast still limped from an
arrow wound in the leg, probably inflicted by an
Indian, and was distrustful of the creatures that
walked on two legs.</p>

<p>Bomba hastily thrust his weapons back into his
pouch. With the help of Doto, who was stronger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
than the average man, he rolled the great stone
slowly, strainingly, toward the yawning mouth of
the cave.</p>

<p>Four feet, five, six. They pushed pantingly.
The rock already covered part of the entrance,
but there was still room for the puma to push
through.</p>

<p>At this point the beast realized what they were
trying to do!</p>

<p>With a blood-curdling snarl of rage it leaped
forward. With one great despairing heave
Bomba and Doto pushed the rock against the
opening, sealing it.</p>

<p>Not a minute, not a second too soon!</p>

<p>The great stone caught the foot of the puma,
crushing it. With a roar of rage and pain the
brute pulled the injured member free and limped
away, all the fight taken out of him for the time.</p>

<p>Bomba leaned against the rock, exhausted but
jubilant. Doto crouched close beside him,
trembling.</p>

<p>Bomba reached out a hand and caressed the
head of the faithful monkey.</p>

<p>“Bomba has good friend in Doto,” said the
lad earnestly. “Doto could have saved himself
in the trees and left Bomba to the hungry jaws
of the puma. Again Doto has saved the life of
Bomba, and Bomba will not forget.”</p>

<p>The monkey snuggled closer against him and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
made a little contented sound like a child that is
happy and humming softly to itself.</p>

<p>“But what Bomba does not understand,” went
on the jungle boy, speaking more to himself than
the monkey, “is how Doto was so sure of finding
the cave. Has Doto been here before?”</p>

<p>Doto made a sound that Bomba interpreted as
assent.</p>

<p>Bomba made a quick exploration of the cave
to make sure that there was no entrance from the
back. Then he lay down for a much-needed rest.</p>

<p>His body was sore and aching, and he was
exhausted physically and mentally by the fearful
strain he had undergone.</p>

<p>Doto lay down close to him, content to be
within reaching distance of a pat from the boy’s
hand.</p>

<p>The mind of Bomba was full of many things.
He was both glad and sorrowful. Glad, because
twice that night he had been snatched from the
very jaws of death. Sorrowful, because by reason
of these perils he had been delayed so long
on his journey to Japazy.</p>

<p>The panic of dread was still upon him lest on
reaching Jaguar Island he might find Japazy gone.</p>

<p>And Casson! Dear old Casson! Was he still
in the land of the living? Had the Hondura perchance
found him, and was he now safe and sound
in the friendly maloca? Bomba scarcely dared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
hope, and yet he forced himself to hope, for he
could not bear the thought that he might not see
the old man again.</p>

<p>Bomba was glad of the presence of Doto, because
it relieved to some extent his loneliness.
Yet even this thought was not without its bitter
quality.</p>

<p>“Bomba is white,” he said to himself, “and yet
he is grateful for the presence of a friendly beast
of the jungle. Will Bomba never know even his
name? Will he never know the name of the
beautiful woman in the picture, the lovely face
that seemed to smile down at Bomba?”</p>

<p>Musing thus, he fell asleep and did not wake
until the sun was painting the jungle in a riot of
gorgeous colors.</p>

<p>It was dark within the cave, but Bomba knew
that the morning had come by the screaming of
the parrots and the chattering of the monkeys
in the jungle without.</p>

<p>He was bent like an old man because of the
soreness in his muscles, and one leg was lame
where the cruel branches of the descending tree
had bruised the tendons.</p>

<p>Doto sensed his condition, and tried by chatter
and gesture to induce the boy to remain in the
cave for a while until his bruised body was well
again.</p>

<p>Bomba hesitated, for he knew well that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
should not face the dangers of the jungle in his
half-crippled condition. The cave was safe.
There was enough cooked meat in the pouch at
his waist to feed both Doto and himself, if the
monkey should elect to stay with him.</p>

<p>The boy was tempted. But then the great urge
to be on his way swept over him. He thought of
Japazy and what he would lose, how great would
be his desperation if he failed to meet the half-breed
and get from him the secret of his birth.</p>

<p>So slowly, reluctantly, he shook his head.</p>

<p>“Bomba must go on, Doto,” he said, as he
smoothed the shaggy head. “The cave is warm and
safe and comfortable and there is meat in plenty
for Bomba and Doto, but Bomba must go into
the jungle to meet whatever waits for him there.
Bomba cannot linger here, even though his going
may mean death to him. He must take his
chance.”</p>

<p>Bomba offered the monkey some of his share
of the tapir meat. But Doto shook his head. He
would eat meat if he were starving, but he preferred
the cocoanuts that he had only to break
open to get at their succulent contents.</p>

<p>But Bomba ate ravenously of the tapir meat,
for he had had nothing to eat since morning of
the day before. The food put new life into him
and prepared him for the strenuous task that lay
before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>With the help of Doto he rolled back the stone
from before the entrance of the cave. They left
a space only wide enough for their own bodies to
pass through, if a survey of their surroundings
should signal the need of retreat.</p>

<p>There was a chance that one of the pumas at
least had not been content to leave the spot where
the boy and the monkey had disappeared. The
enemy might still be waiting among the trees or
thickets ready to pounce on the first that should
issue forth from the cave.</p>

<p>So Bomba moved with the caution that was habitual
with him, hand on his machete, eyes darting
in all directions.</p>

<p>Doto swung himself into the treetops and described
a wide circle about the spot. Bomba
knew that precious little would escape the monkey’s
prying eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monkey’s chatter became so loud
and agitated that Bomba thought it might be
meant as a warning to him, and began to make a
hasty retreat toward the cave.</p>

<p>But in a moment he realized that it was not a
warning but a summons, and he began slowly to
approach the tree from which Doto was hanging
by one paw. With the other he was pointing
eagerly to something that lay on the ground,
hidden, so far, from Bomba’s view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>The boy pushed aside the underbrush and then
understood what had caused Doto’s agitation.</p>

<p>A giant puma lay on its side in a pool of blood,
its throat horribly mangled and torn.</p>

<p>One of the gladiators of the night before!</p>

<p>Bomba knew that but for the timely interference
and help of Doto, he, too, might have been
lying in some such pool as this. But he would
not have been as intact as the puma. All that
would have been left of him would have been a
few scattered bones. He would have furnished
a royal meal for the denizens of the jungle.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment looking thoughtfully
at the beast, his eyes gleaming, lips drawn back
a little to show two rows of even white teeth.</p>

<p>Then he flung back his head and turned to the
monkey.</p>

<p>“Bomba will never forget what Doto has
done,” he said. “But now Bomba must go. He
must say farewell to Doto. It may be many
moons before Bomba will see Doto again.”</p>

<p>The monkey whimpered and put his hand on
Bomba’s shoulder. No human being could have
asked more clearly that he be permitted to go
along.</p>

<p>But Bomba smiled affectionately and patted the
creature’s head.</p>

<p>“Bomba must go alone,” he said. “He must
sail great waters where Doto would be lonely and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
afraid because there were not any trees. Doto
must go back to his own people. But if he ever
needs Bomba and can call to him, Bomba will
come. For Doto has been a good friend to
Bomba.”</p>

<p>He pointed to a tree, and the monkey left him
slowly and reluctantly, swung himself into the
tree, and was soon lost to sight among the foliage.</p>

<p>Bomba looked after him sadly, sighed, and
then began preparations for his journey.</p>

<p>First he looked to his weapons. He found the
revolver in perfect shape, its waterproof covering
having protected it from moisture. He took one
of the strongest and most pliant strings of those
that Hondura had given him and strung it to his
bow. He tested it in every way until he knew
that it could be absolutely depended upon.</p>

<p>For of all his weapons the one on which he
placed most reliance was his bow. To this, he
had been habituated almost from babyhood, and
the skill he had attained was phenomenal. Gillis
and Dorn, the white rubber hunters, had been
dumbfounded at the marvelous accuracy of his
shooting.</p>

<p>At close range with a human opponent the revolver
perhaps would prove the most efficient.
But at a longer distance the bow was the better.
He could send an arrow clear through the body
of any beast of the jungle. The alligator’s body<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
with its tough armor might defy the shaft. But
the alligator had eyes and, small as they were,
they supplied a big enough target for Bomba to
pierce.</p>

<p>“Without this bow,” murmured Bomba to himself,
as he gave it an affectionate pat and slung
it over his shoulder, “what chance would Bomba
have to find meat to eat? How could he defend
himself against the wild beasts that seek his life?
He would be helpless and could never hope to
reach the island of the big cats.”</p>

<p>In his flight to the cave from the pumas Bomba
had departed widely from his original trail, and
it took him some time to find it again. This he
did at last, and struck out once more for that
river that flowed about the island where Japazy
dwelt.</p>

<p>He knew that he was now about to enter upon
the most dangerous part of his journey. The region
into which he was penetrating was wild and
perilous and filled with pitfalls for the unwary
traveler. Because of the superstition surrounding
the sunken city with the towers of gold, the
Indians gave this district a wide berth, and it was
almost wholly devoid of human life.</p>

<p>As a result, the beasts that inhabited the region
had grown bolder and more savage than in more
thickly populated sections. There were no bows
and arrows, no poisoned traps to thin their numbers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
A traveler needed eyes in the back of his
head, and at the sides as well, to guard himself
against the dangers that surrounded him.</p>

<p>Another handicap attached itself to Bomba’s
journey. In that part of the jungle where Bomba
had grown up he had learned of places of
refuge for times of sudden stress. He knew of
caves, of crevices only wide enough for himself
to squeeze through, of deserted cabins, of hollow
trees, of a host of similar hiding places and temporary
fortresses. More than once these had
saved his life when he was hard-pressed. But in
this new region that he was entering he was a
complete stranger. If he came upon a refuge, it
would be by chance. And his foes were legion.</p>

<p>Bomba would have figured out all of these
things by himself, even if he had not been warned
by his friend, Hondura. But not for a moment
did he dream of turning back. As far as is possible
to human nature, the lad was absolutely
devoid of fear. And now, with his trusty bow
again in shape, he went on with renewed confidence.</p>

<p>He came to the banks of a stream and rubbed
his sore muscles with the warm mud. This took
some of the ache from them, and he found that
he could walk with greater ease and make much
better progress. His spirits rose as he dried himself
and swung off buoyantly on the trail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>“Bomba may still be in time to see Japazy and
get the truth from his lips,” he assured himself,
and in that mood felt capable of moving mountains,
even that formidable mountain on which
Jojasta had dwelt.</p>

<p>The hope that before many days had sped he
would have realized his heart’s desire quickened
his steps until he found himself breaking into a
run.</p>

<p>For two days more he traveled along a trail
that grew ever more difficult. The lack of human
inhabitants had caused the trail in many places to
be overgrown, and Bomba’s machete was in almost
constant requisition to hack a way for him. This
involved not only arduous labor but the loss of
precious time, and the boy fumed and fretted.
Yet he never grew discouraged, never even
thought of turning back.</p>

<p>Bomba had never heard the word “impossible.”
If he had, he would not have understood
it. If it had been explained to him, he would have
laughed and refused to believe it. Nothing was
impossible to Bomba, if he had determined to
do it. It would take nothing less than death to
prove that he had been mistaken.</p>

<p>The food he had brought with him from Hondura’s
camp grew monotonous before long, but
he managed to vary his diet by turtle eggs, fish
and the bringing down of an occasional wild pig.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>Sometimes he stopped to cook the meat; at
other times he ate it raw. Always he hurried on,
flogging himself to renewed effort, allowing only
the most meager intervals for food and rest.</p>

<p>Then one day, when he had come upon the
trail of a tapir and was stalking it, that sixth
sense of his told him that he, too, was being followed.</p>

<p>He faced about and stood tense and silent,
eyes searching the shadows of the jungle.</p>

<p>At first he heard and saw nothing and was
almost inclined to chide himself for his suspicions.
Then a slight movement in the underbrush
at his right caught his eye.</p>

<p>Now he saw what had before been hidden from
him, a crouching, sinuous body, ears laid flat
against a wicked head, eyes gleaming and greedy.</p>

<p>“A jaguar!” muttered Bomba, as he quickly
fitted an arrow to his bow. “Already they lie in
wait for me. Bomba must kill this one as a
warning to the others to beware.”</p>

<p>But even as Bomba stretched his bow, the
jaguar, giving a ferocious roar, sprang!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A TERRIFIC BATTLE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> even while the beast was in mid-air, a
great yellow body came hurtling over the underbrush
and struck the jaguar almost at right angles.</p>

<p>The impact was terrible, and the two brutes
went down in a heap. Snarling and spitting, they
scrambled up and faced each other, and the next
moment were engaged in a life and death grapple.</p>

<p>The thud of the collision had come just as
Bomba’s bow twanged. The arrow would have
found its mark unerringly if the body of the
jaguar had not been thrown out of the line of
its flight.</p>

<p>Astounded beyond expression, Bomba thought
for a moment that two jaguars were doing battle
for their prey. But the next moment he recognized
in the newcomer Polulu, the great puma,
Bomba’s chief friend and ally among the jungle
folk.</p>

<p>“Polulu!” he gasped in delight. “Good Polulu!
He saw that Bomba was in danger and has
come to his help.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>It was a titanic struggle that was going on
before his eyes. Both brutes were among the
largest and most powerful of their kind. They
rolled over and over, tearing from each other
great strips of hide, fighting with teeth and claws,
each trying to get a death hold on the other’s
throat.</p>

<p>Bomba drew as near the antagonists as he
could, circling about in an attempt to find a target
in the jaguar. But the two beasts were whirling
about like a giant pinwheel, first one on top
and then the other, and Bomba did not dare use
either arrow or machete for fear that he would
wound or kill Polulu instead of the jaguar.</p>

<p>But Polulu needed no help to dispose of his
enemy. He had no match in the jungle for size
and strength, and was rapidly getting the better
of the combat when, with a savage roar, a second
jaguar, possibly the mate of the first, plunged
into the fight.</p>

<p>The newcomer sank its teeth deep into Polulu’s
flank while at the same time a claw of its hindleg
tore a strip of the puma’s hide. Polulu turned
upon his second assailant and gave him a blow
with his great paw that loosened the brute’s hold
and sent him rolling six feet away. But the
jaguar was up in an instant and returned to the
attack. At the same time the first jaguar, inspired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
to fresh efforts by the coming of its ally,
redoubled the ferocity of its fighting.</p>

<p>The odds were too great. Polulu could have
conquered either jaguar alone with comparative
ease. But with two attacking him at once, he
had no chance.</p>

<p>Such rage swept over Bomba as he had scarcely
ever known before. With a yell of encouragement
to Polulu, he leaped into the fray, throwing
caution to the winds. His only thought was that
Polulu, his friend, must not die.</p>

<p>He buried his hand in the thick fur of the second
jaguar’s neck, and as the beast turned snarling
to meet this new attack, raised his machete
and, with all his force, drove it downward.</p>

<p>He sensed the bite of the sharp steel on flesh,
felt it slip along bone and reach the brain of the
beast.</p>

<p>As though lifted by an earthquake, Bomba was
hurled from the back of the jaguar upon the
ground. With a roar that echoed and re-echoed
through the jungle, the stricken brute rose on its
hind legs, pawed the air blindly for a moment,
and then fell.</p>

<p>Bomba lifted himself, half-dazed, on his elbow
and stared at the great cat, a moment before so
terrible, now stretched out prone and inert.</p>

<p>Then the lad scrambled to his feet, regained
his machete, which had been knocked from his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
hand as he withdrew it, and hurried again to the
help of Polulu.</p>

<p>But Polulu stood in no need of help. Relieved
of the flank attack, he had at last got the hold
upon his opponent’s throat for which he had been
seeking, and in a few moments more the fight
was over.</p>

<p>Polulu rose to his feet and sent a roar of triumph
through the jungle. But he staggered as
he did it, and then he sank down on the ground,
panting, too spent and exhausted even to lick his
wounds.</p>

<p>Bomba was beside him on the instant, caressing
the great brute’s shaggy head. The animal’s eyes,
of late so furious, were now soft with affection,
and it tried weakly to lick Bomba’s hand.</p>

<p>“Good Polulu!” cried the lad. “Brave Polulu!
There is no beast of the jungle so strong
as Polulu, the friend of Bomba. He has saved
Bomba’s life.”</p>

<p>The queer friendship between the two had
begun some years before when Bomba had found
the puma pinned beneath a falling tree that
had caught and broken one of its legs. Bomba
had been stirred to pity by the animal’s plight, had
released it from the trap, bound up the broken
leg, and nursed the puma, bringing it food and
drink until the leg had mended. The brute had
sensed his pity and goodness of heart and had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
been intensely grateful. By the time it was well
again it had grown as fond of Bomba as a dog
is of its master.</p>

<p>Again and again they had met in the jungle,
and on several occasions, in times of great stress,
Bomba had owed his life to the puma’s devotion.
And now he was once more in the animal’s debt.</p>

<p>Bomba saw that the animal was bleeding from
a dozen wounds, many of them deep, from which
the blood was flowing freely. The lad ran to a
stream that rippled through the brushwood not
far off and brought back water with which he
washed the wounds. Then he covered them with
river mud, the universal and healing ointment of
the jungle. Polulu let him do as he would, purring
his gratitude and rubbing his head against
the lad’s body.</p>

<p>Then, having done all he could to sooth the
pain and staunch the bleeding, Bomba offered Polulu
food and drink. But though the beast drank
avidly of the cool water, he would not touch the
food.</p>

<p>Bomba’s own supplies were running low now,
and he saw in the dead jaguars a chance to replenish
them. Jaguar meat was not exactly the
kind of food that would please an epicure, but
it was eatable, and the opportunity could not be
neglected. The lad cut great steaks from the
bodies, built a fire and roasted them. Then he ate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
to repletion and stored what was left away in his
pouch for future needs. By this time Polulu was
so far recovered that he was ready to join in the
feast.</p>

<p>Bomba patted the great brute on the head and
intertwined his fingers in the shaggy mane.</p>

<p>“Bomba is glad that Polulu is strong again,”
the lad said. “Now Polulu can go back to his
mate and tell her how he came to the help of
Bomba when the jaguars were hungry for his
life. If he had lost his life, Bomba would have
grieved for Polulu. Bomba will never forget his
friend. But now Bomba must go on, for he has
lost much time.”</p>

<p>The puma whined, pressed against him, and
looked up into his face as though beseeching that
he might go with him.</p>

<p>But Bomba shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>“Where Bomba goes he must go alone,” he
said. “The man he goes to see would be afraid
if he saw Polulu, and would tell his people to
kill him. Then Bomba’s heart would be heavy.
No, Polulu cannot go. But Bomba will come
back, if it is so decreed, and then he will talk and
feast with Polulu again.”</p>

<p>He pointed back in the direction from which
Polulu had come, and the brute reluctantly
obeyed. Bomba listened until the padding of the
animal’s feet had died away and then once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
turned his face and steps toward Jaguar Island.</p>

<p>He had been warned by the attack of the jaguar
that he must now be doubly on his guard. He
realized that, whereas the big cats usually hesitated
to attack unless they themselves were attacked
or were sorely pressed by hunger, here
in this desolate region they would assail him
boldly, fearlessly, knowing little of man and his
strange powers.</p>

<p>The forces of the jungle would now be unleashed
upon him, and in the matter of mere
physical strength they were stronger than he was.
From now on he must pit his wit against brute
strength, trusting to his keen brain to win against
odds that would otherwise be overwhelming.</p>

<p>So, though he stepped swiftly, he stepped
softly, constantly on the alert, bow and arrows,
machete and revolver ready at hand in case of
need, eyes searching out every moving shadow in
the underbrush.</p>

<p>Before long his supply of meat was exhausted,
for he had had to eat freely to maintain his
strength. He hated to devote any more time to
hunting than he had to, for it meant that much
delay in his journey. Berries and nuts and turtle
eggs helped to eke out his supplies, but he needed
meat.</p>

<p>Luck was with him, for he killed a tapir, and
this time he cured enough of the meat to last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
him, by his calculations, until he could reach the
island of Japazy. Now with his larder stocked,
he could devote himself solely to the one end he
had in view.</p>

<p>His conviction never faltered that once he
came face to face with the half-breed he would
be able to get from him the knowledge he craved,
provided that Japazy had that knowledge. The
possibility of a hostile reception occurred to him
at times, but he dismissed it promptly. Why
should such a natural and simple request arouse
Japazy’s ire? Jojasta had told him something.
Sobrinini had told him more. Why should not
Japazy scatter the last shred of mystery that
hung about the secret of his birth?</p>

<p>Musing thus, he was pushing his way through
an unusually thick part of the jungle late on the
third afternoon after he had left Polulu when
he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>A scream had halted him, a man’s scream, the
scream of one in mortal agony!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>IN THE BOA CONSTRICTOR’S FOLDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Under</span> other circumstances Bomba might have
hesitated before he rushed to the spot from which
that scream proceeded. He would have feared
a decoy, a trap. But there was such genuine terror,
such awful anguish in that blood-curdling
shriek that he hurried with all the speed he could
muster, unslinging his bow as he ran.</p>

<p>In a moment he had reached a little opening in
the jungle, and his blood ran cold at the sight that
met his eyes.</p>

<p>A man, by his color an Indian, was struggling
in the coils of a giant boa constrictor. His features
were distorted with agony. The coils of
the great snake were wound about the man’s right
arm and striving to crush it into pulp.</p>

<p>The victim was tearing wildly at the snake’s
body with the free arm, but as the hand held no
weapon it could make no impression. Another
man was circling frantically about the reptile, trying
to get in a blow with a knife. But he could
not get near enough to slash, as the boa’s head,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
reared aloft, struck viciously at him whenever he
came almost within reaching distance.</p>

<p>Had the snake retained a hold by its tail from
the bough from which it had dropped upon its
prey, the struggle would have long since been
over. But the reptile had made two mistakes.</p>

<p>It had missed the body that it sought to enfold
and, instead, had encircled the arm. And in the
struggle it had lost the grip of its tail upon the
bough above and had come floundering to the
earth.</p>

<p>Now the great body was lashing wildly about,
the tail seeking a stump or a tree trunk on which
it could get a grip. With this for purchase, it
could crush its victim instantly, draw the body
into its coils, squeeze it into a shapeless mass,
and then devour it at leisure.</p>

<p>Bomba sensed the situation in an instant.
There was not a second to lose. Already the
snake’s tail was brushing the trunk of a tree and,
feeling the contact, it was pulling its victim in the
required direction.</p>

<p>Bomba’s first thought was of his machete.
With that he might sever the reptile’s spine and
render it helpless. But he dismissed this at once.
He could not get near enough.</p>

<p>Like a flash he raised his bow to his shoulder.
He shouted, and the reptile reared its head and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
hissed at him viciously. That moment was enough
to give Bomba the target he needed.</p>

<p>The bow twanged and the arrow transfixed that
hideous head.</p>

<p>There was a fearful hissing and thrashing, the
coils fell apart, and the body of the reptile
dropped to the ground. There it floundered
about for a minute or two and then lay motionless.</p>

<p>The man who had so narrowly escaped a horrible
death had fallen to the earth and lay there
in a crumpled heap.</p>

<p>Bomba jumped to his side, lifted the man’s head
and supported it on his knees.</p>

<p>At the same instant the man’s companion
sprang to offer a similar service, and he and
Bomba came face to face.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of astonished recognition.</p>

<p>“Bomba!”</p>

<p>“Neram!”</p>

<p>Bomba found himself looking into the eyes of
Neram, one of the two slaves he had rescued from
the tyranny of Jojasta on his memorable visit to
the Moving Mountain.</p>

<p>The delight of Neram at the meeting was unbounded,
and that of Bomba was scarcely less
great.</p>

<p>Following Bomba’s rescue of Sobrinini, the ex-slaves
had begged to be permitted to go with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
to Pipina’s cabin. Bomba had assented, and they
had proved of great value in replenishing the food
supplies of the little household as well as in helping
Pipina take care of Casson and Sobrinini.</p>

<p>Later on, when the half-demented old woman
had wandered away into the jungle, Bomba had
sent Ashati and Neram to hunt for her, as they
were skilled in all the lore of the jungle. They
had gone on their search reluctantly, as they had
a superstitious fear of Sobrinini, whom they regarded
as a witch. Weeks passed by and lengthened
into months with no word either of Sobrinini
or of the ex-slaves. Bomba had reluctantly
come to the conclusion that they had perished.
And now, in this most unexpected manner, he had
come upon them again!</p>

<p>There was little time at present for explanations,
for Ashati demanded all their attention.
The man had fainted from fright and pain.
Neram ran to get some water, while Bomba
chafed his wrists and slapped his face.</p>

<p>It was not long before, under these ministrations,
Ashati opened his eyes. An expression of
panic came over his features as memory returned
to him.</p>

<p>“The snake! The big snake!” he shrieked.</p>

<p>“He is dead,” replied Neram. “He will hurt
Ashati no more. Bomba has killed him.”</p>

<p>“Bomba?” exclaimed Ashati excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>He turned his head from Neram, and as his
gaze fell upon Bomba such a look of rapturous
delight and doglike devotion came into his eyes
that the lad’s heart was touched.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bomba is here,” said the jungle boy,
as he put his hand affectionately on Ashati’s head.
“Bomba heard Ashati scream and he came to his
help. But now Ashati must let Bomba see his
arm where the big snake held him.”</p>

<p>The lad examined with care the man’s arm,
which was black to the shoulder and swollen to
nearly double its usual size. But to his relief he
established that the bone was not broken. If the
snake had been able to get a tail hold the bone
would have been snapped like a pipe stem.</p>

<p>Bomba and Neram bathed the arm and applied
a plaster of river mud. Then they propped the
man as comfortably as they could against the
back of a tree, first making a careful examination
of the branches to see that no other monster
lurked above.</p>

<p>“Bomba is great,” murmured the grateful sufferer,
as he looked with a shudder at the hideous
body of the dead snake. “Bomba is good. There
is no one so brave as Bomba in the jungle. And
none can shoot as straight and kill as quickly.”</p>

<p>“Bomba is glad that he came in time,” returned
the lad gravely. “But his arrow would
have done no good if the snake had got its tail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
around a tree. It was a foolish snake to let go of
the bough. But how is it that Ashati did not see
that the snake was in the tree?”</p>

<p>“Ashati had looked,” returned the man; “but
some demon must have blinded his eyes, for he
saw nothing. He was bending over to get some
wood for a fire when the big snake dropped and
wound itself about his arm.”</p>

<p>“Neram tried to help Ashati,” broke in Neram.
“But he could not get close with his knife.
And Neram did not dare shoot his arrow for fear
he would kill Ashati. Neram cannot shoot as
straight as Bomba.”</p>

<p>“The gods have been good,” returned Bomba.
“The big snake is dead. We will eat of its flesh,
for it is good. Neram will make a fire and we
will feast. Then Ashati and Neram will tell
Bomba where they have been and what they have
done since they left the cabin of Pipina.”</p>

<p>In a short time the fire was blazing and the
choicest portions of the snake were being roasted.
They ate in silence, as is the custom of the people
of the jungle, and it was only when their appetites
were fully satisfied that Bomba spoke.</p>

<p>“Tell Bomba now,” he commanded, “where
have been the comings and goings of Ashati and
Neram since they left the cabin of the good squaw
Pipina. They went to look for Sobrinini. Did
they find her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Neram and Ashati did not find her,” replied
the former. “There was no sign of Sobrinini in
the jungle. There were no footprints. She must
have melted into air. She could have done this,
for she was a witch.”</p>

<p>“She was a witch,” echoed Ashati, making a
cabalistic sign to ward off evil spirits.</p>

<p>“Ashati and Neram talk foolish words,” replied
Bomba impatiently. “There is no such thing
as a witch.”</p>

<p>The ex-slaves were silent but by no means convinced.
Superstition was woven into the very
warp and woof of their natures.</p>

<p>“If Ashati and Neram could not find Sobrinini,”
went on Bomba, after a moment of meditation,
“why did they not come back to the cabin of
Pipina and tell Bomba?”</p>

<p>“They wanted to come,” replied Neram, “but
Neram was taken sick with fever in the jungle,
and it was many weeks before he was strong
enough to walk. And then Ashati’s leg was hurt
in a fight with a jaguar that he killed. Ashati and
Neram are on their way now to Pipina’s cabin.
And Bomba will go with us. That is good.”</p>

<p>“No, Bomba will not go,” replied the lad.
“He is going on a long journey. And Ashati and
Neram will not find the cabin of Pipina. It is
gone.”</p>

<p>“Gone?” his hearers exclaimed simultaneously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Yes,” returned Bomba. “The headhunters
burned it with fire.”</p>

<p>“The headhunters!” cried Neram, a shudder
going through him at the mention of the dread
name.</p>

<p>“May the curse of the gods rest upon them!”
growled Ashati.</p>

<p>“And the good Casson? And Pipina?” asked
Neram anxiously. “Are they hurt? Did the
headhunters carry them away?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Bomba. “Pipina got away, and
Bomba has taken her to the camp of the good
chief, Hondura. But Casson wandered away into
the jungle. Bomba has looked hard for him, but
could not find him. Now the bucks of Hondura
are looking for Casson.</p>

<p>“Now listen well to the words of Bomba,” he
continued. “Ashati and Neram will go to the
maloca of Hondura. They are good hunters, and
the chief will be glad to have them among his
bucks. They will tell Hondura that Bomba has
sent them and that they will hunt for Casson and
make their home with Hondura till Bomba gets
back.”</p>

<p>“Neram and Ashati will do what Bomba says,”
returned the former. “But Bomba speaks of a
long journey. Where is it that Bomba goes?”</p>

<p>“Bomba goes to see Japazy, the half-breed,
who lives on Jaguar Island,” the lad replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>The ex-slaves shuddered at Bomba’s words.
Their features became livid with fear.</p>

<p>“Jaguar Island!” exclaimed Ashati.</p>

<p>“To go to Jaguar Island is death,” declared
Neram solemnly.</p>

<p>“That is what Neram and Ashati said before
when Bomba went to the island of snakes to find
Sobrinini,” replied the lad. “But Bomba did not
die.”</p>

<p>“To go to Jaguar Island is death,” repeated
Neram stubbornly.</p>

<p>“They are foolish words that Neram speaks,”
said Bomba. “There is death in many places,
and Bomba has faced it often. He will face it
again, if it is at Jaguar Island. But why is Neram
so afraid that his blood is like water in his veins?
Is it because of the jaguars? Bomba has his
bow and his machete.”</p>

<p>“The arrow is swift and the knife is sharp,”
murmured Neram in a singsong voice. “But there
are things that the arrow cannot pierce and the
knife cannot bite.”</p>

<p>“What things?” asked Bomba, with a tinge of
skepticism in his tone.</p>

<p>“Ghosts,” said Neram.</p>

<p>“Demons,” added Ashati.</p>

<p>Despite himself, Bomba was impressed by the
utter conviction expressed by the two. This was
what Hondura had said. Was there indeed some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
foundation for the dread that seemed to seize
everybody at the mention of Jaguar Island?</p>

<p>“Bomba has never seen a ghost or a demon,”
the lad said, with an attempt at lightness.</p>

<p>“But they have seen him,” returned Ashati,
with a shiver. “Perhaps they are looking at
Bomba now.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the ex-slaves glanced about affrightedly
at the darkening shadows of the jungle and
Bomba felt as though cold water were trickling
down his spine.</p>

<p>“If there are ghosts and demons there, how is
it that Japazy still lives?” he objected.</p>

<p>“Because he is a man of magic,” replied Neram.
“He is more powerful even than was
Jojasta.”</p>

<p>“He is the lord of ghosts and demons,” declared
Ashati. “They do his bidding.”</p>

<p>Again that chill ran along Bomba’s spine.</p>

<p>What was it that Neram had said?</p>

<p>“Things that the arrow cannot pierce and the
knife cannot bite!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>EYES THAT GLARED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> an exclamation of impatience, Bomba
broke the spell that was stealing over him and
leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Bomba will go!” he cried, and his vibrant
voice rang out like a challenge through the jungle.
“Is Bomba a woman to listen to such things and
tremble? Shall he whimper as the monkey whimpers
when he hears the roar of the jaguar? No!
Bomba will go. He will face the jaguars. He
will face the ghosts. He will face the demons.
Bomba has spoken!”</p>

<p>Ashati gave vent to a wailing cry and Neram
covered his face with his hands. In their superstitious
fancy Bomba was already as good as
dead.</p>

<p>“Bomba is brave,” Ashati moaned, “but it is
not well to brave the things that come from
another world.”</p>

<p>“Bomba’s life is his own,” returned the lad.
“He does with it as he wills. He would rather
die than have it said that Bomba was afraid.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>There was silence for a time following his
declaration. The ex-slaves were wrapped in
gloom. They loved Bomba, and would have
given their lives for him. But they knew the boy
well enough to be sure that he would not recede
an inch from the plan that he had formed.</p>

<p>Bomba himself was thinking deeply. It had
been in his mind to ask Ashati and Neram to
accompany him. The loneliness of his days and
nights was wearing upon him. It would be good
to have companionship, some one to whom he
could talk at times and unburden his heart. Then,
too, Ashati and Neram were skilled in woodcraft
and could be of service to him in this wild and
unknown part of the country.</p>

<p>But he dismissed the thought almost as soon
as it came to him. He did not want to drag them
into danger. It was his own personal errand on
which he was going, and he himself must face all
that was involved in it. He knew that they would
go if he asked them, even though they felt sure
that they were going to their death. There was
no limit to their devotion. But he would not
accept the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Something of what he was thinking must have
been felt by them, for Ashati came to him, prostrated
himself on the ground and put Bomba’s
foot upon his neck.</p>

<p>“Ashati will go with Bomba,” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
“Bomba is Ashati’s chief. Twice he has saved
Ashati’s life. His life belongs to Bomba.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” put in Neram, “we will follow Bomba
even to the land of ghosts and demons.”</p>

<p>The lad was profoundly touched, for he knew
that each believed that he was signing his own
death warrant.</p>

<p>“Ashati and Neram are good, and Bomba will
not forget,” he said. “But where Bomba goes
he must go alone. And now Bomba has spoken,
and there is no need for more words about his
going. But it may be that Ashati and Neram
can tell Bomba some good words about the trail
and what he must do to get to Jaguar Island
when he reaches the great water.”</p>

<p>“Ashati and Neram have never been in that
part of the jungle,” said the latter. “But they
have heard about it from the old men of the tribe.
It is two days’ journey beyond the Giant Cataract
that Bomba must go before he reaches the great
water. Then he must get a canoe or a raft and
let the water carry him where it will. He will
not need a paddle, except to steer, for the water
is very strong and it will carry him until he
touches Jaguar Island.”</p>

<p>Again a shudder stole through Neram as he
mentioned that sinister name.</p>

<p>Ashati added further details of the journey,
and by the time the conference was finished Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
had gained a great deal of information that
would be of service to him.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said the lad. “And now it is time
that we sleep, for Bomba must start as soon as
the sun comes up in the sky. We will gather
wood and make a great fire to make the beasts
afraid, and then we shall rest.”</p>

<p>He proposed that they should take turns in
watching, lest the fire should go down. But Neram
would not hear of this. That much at least
he could do for his master. He would watch
through the whole night so that Bomba could
get the rest he needed for the task that lay before
him. And finding that Neram was so much in
earnest, Bomba did not protest.</p>

<p>The boy slept as soon as his head touched the
ground, and did not wake till he felt Neram’s
hand upon his shoulder at the first streak of
dawn.</p>

<p>The faithful ex-slave had composed a savory
stew, and they all ate heartily. Ashati’s arm,
though still painful, was much better, and a great
deal of the swelling had gone down.</p>

<p>“And now,” said Bomba, as he made a last
examination of his weapons, “it is time for Bomba
to go. He will think often of Ashati and Neram
and will be glad that they are in the maloca of
the good chief Hondura. They will be good to
Pipina and bring her much meat. And they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
try to find Casson. If they do find him, Bomba’s
heart will be more glad than it has been for many
moons.”</p>

<p>“Neram and Ashati will do what they can to
find Casson,” promised the former.</p>

<p>“And they will give much meat to the medicine
man so that he may pray to his gods for Bomba,”
added Ashati.</p>

<p>With a last wave of the hand, Bomba left them,
and they stood looking after him until the jungle
swallowed him up. Then, with heavy hearts, they
took the backward trail to Hondura’s camp.</p>

<p>Bomba went on at a good rate of speed. The
sound sleep that he had enjoyed had recuperated
him immensely. Thanks, too, to the explicit information
he had got from the ex-slaves, he now
moved with more certainty directly toward his
goal.</p>

<p>He grieved for Sobrinini, for, though he had
no deep affection for the old woman, she had been
kind to him. Then, too, she had been a sort of
slender link between him and the parents he had
never known well enough to remember. Sobrinini
had known them and had sought to tell
Bomba about them, but the twist in her poor
brain had made it impossible. She had, however,
given him the clue to Japazy as possessing the
knowledge he sought, and for this Bomba was
grateful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Much more than for Sobrinini did he sorrow
for Casson. Dear old Casson had been a part
of his life. It was hard to think of existence
without him. And he had been white, so different
from the brown-skinned natives with their
ignorance, their superstition, their narrowed
lives.</p>

<p>White! That was the most precious word in
Bomba’s limited vocabulary. For it marked him
out as different from the forms of life by which
he was surrounded. He wanted to be different.
He wanted to be like Gillis and Dorn, the white
rubber hunters, the men who laughed and slapped
each other on the back. There was little laughter
in the jungle. Bomba wanted some companion,
some one with whom he could laugh, whom he
could slap on the back. Some one like Frank
Parkhurst, who had seen so much, who had told
him about the great ocean, of mighty cities.</p>

<p>He thought of the promises of the rubber
hunters and the Parkhursts that they would come
back and take Bomba from the jungle. No doubt
they had been sincere enough at the time, but
many moons had passed now with no word from
them. Perhaps they had been killed by savages
or wild beasts before they got back to the coast.</p>

<p>More likely, Bomba thought, with a tinge of
bitterness, they had forgotten him.</p>

<p>“After all,” he said to himself, “what is Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
but a thing of the jungle? They would be
ashamed to show him to their white friends. And
yet that thing of the jungle saved their lives.
Bomba’s knife was good when they needed it.
Bomba’s arrows were good. But now they have
forgotten him as the jungle forgets the mists after
the sun has risen.”</p>

<p>But into these gloomy ponderings shot a gleam
of hope. Japazy still was left! He might tell
him of his parents, who they were and where they
lived. If he did, Bomba would search out those
parents, even if they were at the other end of the
world. How glad he would be to see them! And
how glad they would be to see him!</p>

<p>But would they be glad? Or would they, too,
be ashamed of Bomba, the boy of the jungle, the
boy of the puma skin, the boy who tore his food
with his fingers when he ate, the boy who had
shyly watched Gillis and Dorn at their meals and
wished that he could eat as they did.</p>

<p>But no! That lovely woman who had smiled
down at him from the picture in the hut of Sobrinini,
if she were indeed his mother, would not be
ashamed of Bomba. She would gather him to
her heart. She would kiss him, as the woman
with the golden hair had kissed him when he had
saved her from the headhunters of Nascanora.</p>

<p>For some time past, as he journeyed on engrossed
in thought, Bomba had been conscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
of a rumbling in the distance. It was so far away
that he had paid little attention to it. Now it had
grown louder, and it forced itself upon his attention.</p>

<p>Was it thunder? The sky was azure and the
sun was shining with dazzling brilliance. The
sound could not be thunder.</p>

<p>Then the truth broke upon Bomba. It was the
roar of the Giant Cataract!</p>

<p>That mighty body of water was miles and
miles away, but the sound carried far in the clear
air.</p>

<p>Bomba was perhaps twenty miles to the left of
it. Now he hastened to make the distance still
greater. For at the Giant Cataract was the village
of Nascanora, he whose nose Bomba had
crushed, he who was reserving a special place on
the top of his wigwam for the head of the jungle
boy who had shamed him before his followers and
defied him.</p>

<p>Bomba described a wide semicircle that would
bring him to the river he sought many miles above
the Giant Cataract. He had little fear of meeting
any headhunters in the district toward which
he was heading, for they were probably imbued
with same superstitious fear of Japazy and Jaguar
Island that had possessed Ashati and Neram,
and would give the region a wide berth. Still, it
was well to take no chances, and he drove from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
his mind for the moment all thoughts of his parentage
and devoted himself strictly to the matter
in hand.</p>

<p>By the evening of the next day, he figured, he
would reach the river bank. Then he would make
his raft and launch himself into the unknown.
The strong current of the river would carry him
along to Jaguar Island.</p>

<p>To what else? To the knowledge that he
craved? Or to death?</p>

<p>If the former, he would be supremely happy.
If the latter—well, Bomba had known how to live.
He would know how to die.</p>

<p>As the shades of night were drawing on he
came to an old ramshackle native hut, long since
abandoned. There was no door. Only the four
walls were standing, and they were bending
crazily.</p>

<p>Even at that, however, it offered more protection
than that to which the lad had been accustomed.
He could build a big fire before the door
of the hut. That would protect him on one side,
and the walls would shelter him on the other three
sides from the incursions of serpents and wild
beasts.</p>

<p>He had had a hard, exhausting day and was
very tired. He built his fire, brought water from
a little stream near at hand, made a native tea
from bitter leaves he gathered and feasted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
heartily upon the tapir meat, of which he had yet
a considerable store on hand.</p>

<p>Then he lay down to sleep on the earthen floor
of the hut. His tired eyes closed almost instantly.</p>

<p>How long he slept he did not know. But he
was awakened at last by a queer sensation, as
though he were rocking up and down in a canoe.</p>

<p>His first thought was of earthquake. It was a
common enough occurrence in that district, which
had once abounded in volcanoes, most of them
now extinct.</p>

<p>But there was no roar or rumbling, such as
usually accompanied a quake. There was no
sound save the usual buzz and hum of the jungle.</p>

<p>Bomba sprang to his feet, every sense on the
alert.</p>

<p>Beneath the place where he had been lying the
earthen floor was heaving like the waves.</p>

<p>Then it broke apart, and from the shattered
opening rose a great head whose open jaws were
armed with terrible rows of teeth.</p>

<p>Bomba looked into the fiery eyes of a monster
alligator!</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>THE RUSHING RIVER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment the lad stood as though turned
into stone, astounded and appalled. Then he
realized what had happened.</p>

<p>The alligator, following a custom of its kind,
had buried itself in the soft mud, on the same
principle that a bear hibernates in winter. Probably
a flood some time before had inundated the
district and the alligator had come with it. When
the flood receded the alligator had remained in its
self-imposed burial place. The soft mud had
caked and hardened, but still the alligator slept
on.</p>

<p>The weight and warmth of the boy’s body had
aroused it, and now it was issuing forth to renew
once more its active life.</p>

<p>For a moment the great brute seemed as much
surprised as the lad himself, and looked stupidly
at the invader of its retreat.</p>

<p>But only for a moment. Then a hideous bellow
issued from its open jaws, its fiery eyes snapped
with malignity, and it made a lunge at the jungle
boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>But the lunge was an instant too late.</p>

<p>For Bomba had shaken off the paralysis that
the sight of the monster had brought upon him,
and with one bound had cleared the doorway,
leaping high over the fire that blazed in front of
the hut.</p>

<p>With speed incredible in so clumsy a creature,
the alligator pursued him. But it could not leap
like Bomba, and with the torpor of its long sleep
confusing it and the light of the fire blinding it,
plunged headlong into the flames.</p>

<p>There was a tremendous bellowing and thrashing
about, a scattering of the embers in every
direction, and then the half-blinded creature lumbered
out and made for the jungle, forgetting in
its own pain and bewilderment all about its human
enemy.</p>

<p>Bomba had not the slightest desire to hinder
its going. He probably could have slain it with
one of his arrows, but he forbore, glad enough
to be rid so suddenly of an awful problem.</p>

<p>But there was no more sleep for him that night.
He had been too thoroughly shaken. He made
up the fire again and sat down beside it, keeping
a careful watch lest the monster, still lurking
in the vicinity, should return to take vengeance
on the author of its misadventure.</p>

<p>But nothing happened during the remainder of
the night, and at the first streak of dawn Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
made a hasty breakfast and set out once more on
the trail.</p>

<p>The jungle thinned as he went on, and he was
able to make such rapid progress that it was only
a little after noon when he reached the banks of
the great river in which somewhere was Jaguar
Island.</p>

<p>It was a black, ominous stream, with a current
that ran like a mill-race. At intervals along its
length were foaming rapids that made navigation
extremely perilous. Islands dotted its expanse
here and there, but none of these within Bomba’s
sight were of any great size.</p>

<p>Where Bomba stood the river was about half
a mile in width, but a little further down it expanded
to more than twice that width. Great
trees fringed the banks, the foliage reaching far
out over the water.</p>

<p>Bomba hunted the banks for a long distance on
the chance that he might find the canoe of some
Indian, either abandoned or hidden in the sedge
grass near the shore. He was an expert in navigating
that type of craft, and would have felt
much safer in it than on a raft that would be
wholly at the mercy of the torrent.</p>

<p>But, search as he would, he could find no craft
of any sort, and when he had fully convinced
himself that there was no other alternative, he
set to work to build his raft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>There were plenty of fallen trees and broken
branches that had been victims of one of the
storms that had swept the jungle, and the boy had
little difficulty in getting enough of the right size
and shape of logs to make the raft he had in mind.
It was not to be an elaborate structure, but it
must be strong, for upon its stability his life might
depend.</p>

<p>He had no implements of any kind, except his
machete. He had no nails or hammer with which
to fasten a flooring to the logs to hold them together.
But there was an abundance of withes
and creepers that, twisted together, were as strong
as any rope, and these he wound about the logs
in such a way that they could not break loose
from one another.</p>

<p>It did not add to his peace of mind to note from
time to time an alligator’s body break the water.
Sometimes they sank again after a lazy glance.
More often they swam around sluggishly, watching
Bomba with their little eyes as though calculating
how long it would be before he could be
depended on to furnish them a meal. It was evident
that the river was fairly swarming with the
terrible creatures.</p>

<p>But these were foes that could be reckoned
with, foes that were not immune from arrow
and knife. They were different from ghosts and
demons, those vague, shadowy, yet awful things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
of which Hondura, Neram and Ashati had
spoken.</p>

<p>Were there any such things? Bomba did not
believe there were. Still, he would have given a
great deal to have been perfectly sure on that
point. And almost involuntarily at times his eyes
would wander to the surrounding jungle.</p>

<p>After two days’ labor his work was done, and
he surveyed it with satisfaction. It was as nearly
square as he could make it and sufficiently large
so that it would not easily overturn. In addition
to the raft, he had shaped a rough paddle for his
steering and a long pole to work the raft loose,
if it grounded in a shallow.</p>

<p>He had been working close to the edge of the
bank, and when the raft was completed he pushed
it over into the water. Then he jumped on
board and, standing near the front with the
paddle in his hand, committed himself to the
mercy of the current.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when he started, so
late, in fact, that he was almost tempted to wait
till the following morning. But now that he was
so near the completion of his journey the urge in
him to hurry was too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>The moon was full and would rise early, and
from this he would get all the light he needed.</p>

<p>The current was stronger than he had thought,
and the clumsy raft was borne along upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
surface at a surprising rate of speed. At times
it was caught in a cross-current and whirled about,
and Bomba had all he could do to keep his balance.
And it was extremely desirable that he
should keep his balance. It would not do to be
thrown into the water.</p>

<p>For Bomba had not started alone. A grim
retinue accompanied him. As he had conjectured,
the river was alive with caymans. Some were
swimming along behind him, their greedy eyes
fixed unblinkingly upon the daring young voyager.
Others came to the surface as his raft was carried
along and joined in the procession. Once let
Bomba get in the water, and he would be torn to
pieces in a twinkling.</p>

<p>No one knew this better than the lad himself,
and every nerve in his body was at its extreme
tension.</p>

<p>Not only from his foes in the water was he in
danger. At times the current swept him in so close
to the shore that he passed under the branches of
the overhanging trees. These, too, he had to
scan, lest any innocent looking bough should suddenly
come to life and prove to be the body of
an anaconda ready to dart down like lightning
upon its prey.</p>

<p>Once he came to a rapids where the churning
water made all attempts to steer impossible, and
his raft was tossed about like a chip. One sudden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
heave threw Bomba to the floor of the raft,
and he all but slid into the water. But he caught
his hands in the crevices of the logs and held on
for dear life.</p>

<p>And now he noted that the alligators were closing
in upon him. They were growing impatient.
Hitherto, they had been content to follow the
raft, expecting every moment that the craft would
be upset. But as time passed and this did not
happen they became more ugly and aggressive.</p>

<p>One of them swam under the raft and then rose
suddenly, lifting it on its back, almost upsetting
it. The raft rose to a perilous angle, but righted
just in time and fell back with a splash into the
water.</p>

<p>The ruse had not succeeded, but there was little
doubt that it would be repeated, and Bomba concluded
that it was time to teach his enemies a
lesson.</p>

<p>He selected the largest of the alligators, and,
reaching for bow and arrow, took careful aim
at one of its eyes. The arrow went straight to
the reptile’s brain. Its dying flurry churned the
water into foam, but before the body could sink
half a dozen of its mates were upon it.</p>

<p>In a minute they had torn the body into fragments
and the water was red with blood. The
monsters sank to the bottom to regale themselves.</p>

<p>The killing of the cayman helped Bomba in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
more ways than one. It not only reduced the
number of his enemies, but it kept the others busy
with the feast that its body provided. Moreover,
it taught the brutes that the boy was not
as helpless as they had supposed, and they were
likely to be a trifle more wary and cautious in
future.</p>

<p>While the caymans were disposing of their
booty, the swift current had carried Bomba a
long distance ahead. His eyes strained through
the gathering darkness, but he could see nothing
of his former pursuers. He hoped that he had
shaken them off.</p>

<p>Vain hope! For in a little while he could see
phosphorescent gleams in the water behind him
that he knew marked the trails of the caymans.</p>

<p>They were coming again. Their appetite for
blood had not been satiated. Rather it had been
whetted.</p>

<p>They wanted Bomba! And they were determined
to have him!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>JAGUAR ISLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Despite</span> his iron courage, Bomba could not
repress a shudder.</p>

<p>To be sure, he still had his bow and arrows,
and what he had done once he might do again.</p>

<p>But now he was handicapped by the darkness.
It had come on swiftly. It would be almost half
an hour before the moon would rise. And how
could he shoot in the darkness at such a tiny target
as the eye of the alligator?</p>

<p>For he must kill it there or nowhere. Against
the tough, scaly armor that covered the brute
from snout to tail, fifty arrows might strike as
harmlessly as hail on a roof.</p>

<p>He strained his eyes through the darkness
ahead, hoping to see some still blacker blot that
might betray the presence of land. He felt that
by now he must be somewhere in the vicinity of
the island of the big cats. Whatever danger
awaited him there, he would face gladly rather
than endure the fate that threatened him from
the waters in his wake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>Those phosphorescent streaks were drawing
closer now. One in particular was not more than
twenty feet away.</p>

<p>Then there came a rush, and a huge alligator
hurled itself out of the water and came down
with half its body on the raft. Its open jaws
snapped at Bomba’s legs.</p>

<p>Quick as lightning, Bomba grabbed the long
pole, and with all the strength of his muscular
arms rammed it down the monster’s throat.</p>

<p>The brute slid off the raft into the water, and
instantly its comrades were on it like a pack of
wolves.</p>

<p>Relieved of its burden, the raft righted and
swung ahead in the current. A moment later it
came up against a jutting point of land with a
shock that almost jarred Bomba off his feet.</p>

<p>But he caught hold of an overhanging branch
and held the raft steady. Gradually he pulled it
in until it grounded on a shelving beach.</p>

<p>Still maintaining his hold on the bough with one
hand, Bomba took from around his neck where he
had wound it a strong rope of creepers and fastened
the raft to the bough so that it could not
drift away. Then he leaped to shore.</p>

<p>He threw himself on the ground at full length,
panting and exhausted.</p>

<p>Land! To feel the solid earth beneath him
after the nightmare of that awful journey through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
the seething waters. Now let the alligators rage!
He had cheated them on their own element.</p>

<p>But had he cheated them? He must not grow
careless. The alligators could travel on land as
well as in the water. They were close at hand,
and one or more might come creeping up the
bank.</p>

<p>So, tired as he was, he got to his feet and made
his way cautiously inland until he came to a
thorn thicket, into which he burrowed, not without
scratches on arms and legs. But what were
scratches to one who had escaped the jaws of the
caymans?</p>

<p>Was he on Jaguar Island? Or had he struck
a smaller island? Ashati and Neram had told
him of one that stood in the river two miles above
the island of the big cats. Perhaps it was this
one on which his raft had grounded.</p>

<p>He need not wait long to know. The moon
would soon be up, flooding all the world with
light. Then he could make a survey of his surroundings
and get his bearings.</p>

<p>In the meantime, rest was unspeakably sweet.
The terrific strain under which he had been during
that perilous journey down the river had
tested his strength and endurance to the uttermost.
Now he relaxed.</p>

<p>But he did not sleep. For, if he were not
already on Jaguar Island, he still had a trip to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
make that night. He had vowed to himself that
he would not sleep until he had reached the island
where Japazy dwelt. Then only would he lie
down to slumber.</p>

<p>Perhaps to the slumber that knows no waking!
He knew that, too. But the possibility did not
for one moment swerve him from his purpose.</p>

<p>A little while later a faint light came flickering
in among the trees. The moon was rising.
Bomba waited for a few minutes more and then
emerged from his shelter and looked about him.</p>

<p>A little scouting showed him that he was not
on Jaguar Island. There was no semblance of
human habitation of any kind. The island was
only a few acres in extent, and in a little while he
had walked all around it.</p>

<p>Once more he would trust himself to the swift
turbulent river.</p>

<p>He came to the place where his raft was swinging
in the sedge grass near the shore. His eyes
scanned the river anxiously. But there were no
more of those streaks of phosphorescence in evidence.
The alligators had waited for a while
perhaps, angry and disappointed, and then returned
sullenly to their usual haunts.</p>

<p>To be sure, others might come and take their
places, but as Bomba knew that the brutes usually
slept at night he did not apprehend much danger
on that score.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>He unlashed the raft from its mooring and
with a hard push of his paddle sent it out from the
shore, where it was promptly caught in the grip
of the current.</p>

<p>Now he was on the last lap of his journey, the
journey that had taken him so many weary days,
that had been so full of peril and adventure, and
during which his life had so many times seemed
to depend upon the turning of a hair.</p>

<p>Was not the very fact that he had been so preserved,
Bomba asked himself, a proof that the
gods of the Indians, in whom he half believed,
were on his side? Surely he could not have come
so far only to be mocked at last at the very moment
when the end of his mission was in sight.</p>

<p>From these reflections Bomba derived what
comfort he could, while his keen eyes scanned the
tumbling waters ahead of him and darted from
shore to shore.</p>

<p>Presently he became conscious of an odd humming
sound, as of the buzzing of innumerable
bees. In fact, he thought that a hive might be
swarming from one side of the river to the other,
and looked to see if he could detect the presence
of the insects in the moonlight. Then he remembered
that the bees swarmed only in the daytime.</p>

<p>Now the noise took on a deeper note, and with
the humming were mingled discordant notes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
rumbling notes, ominous notes, with an occasional
crash as of faraway thunder.</p>

<p>Something like this Bomba had heard on his
visit to the Moving Mountain. At that time they
had been a prelude to a frightful earthquake.
Was anything of that kind threatening now?</p>

<p>While he was seeking some solution, his eyes
caught sight of a light on the river ahead of him.
He thought at first it might be a torch in the
canoe of some native. But if that had been so,
it would have moved steadily in one direction.</p>

<p>Instead, it leaped about irregularly as though
a sport of the wind and waters. Then it disappeared
altogether.</p>

<p>Now other lights, some faint, some bright, began
to stud the surface of the stream. There
were many of them, and they flared up and went
out as though at the caprice of a magician. All
the time the humming sound persisted.</p>

<p>Bomba began to feel the hair slowly rising on
his head. This transcended anything in his experience.
He recalled the warnings of Hondura,
of Neram and Ashati. Was he entering a realm
of spirits, of malignant ghosts and demons?
Were they even now laughing in glee as they saw
the young voyager coming within their reach?</p>

<p>So engrossed was he in these eerie imaginings
that for a moment his vigilant watch of the course
he was taking lessened. He was brought to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
rude sense of reality when his raft struck violently
on a rock that protruded above the boiling foam
of a rapid, so violently that it broke apart, the
tough withes that bound it snapped by the force
of the impact.</p>

<p>The next moment Bomba found himself struggling
in the waters of the river.</p>

<p>He rose to the surface and shook the spray
from his eyes. In the churning waters he could
see the separated logs of the raft tossing about
in wild confusion. He grasped one of them and
hung on desperately until the current carried him
and his slender support into the comparatively
quiet waters beyond.</p>

<p>Then he climbed up on the log and sat on it
astride.</p>

<p>His mind was a welter of conflicting thoughts
and emotions. In a moment the whole outlook
had changed. He had been in comparative safety
as long as the raft was beneath his feet. Now
he was a mere floating derelict, unable to shape
his course, powerless to use his weapons if he
were assailed.</p>

<p>The other logs were tossing about in dangerous
proximity. At any moment one of them might
be hurled against him, breaking a leg or knocking
him senseless.</p>

<p>And the caymans!</p>

<p>He looked behind him fearfully. But there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
were none of those phosphorescent streaks to
betray the presence of the monsters. How long
would it be, however, before there would be a
break of the water and the emerging of the hideous
head of one of the lords of the river!</p>

<p>Sitting astride the log, his legs were hanging
in the water. One bite of the alligator’s jaws and
a leg would be severed as though shorn by shears.</p>

<p>But he was nearing land. That was one comfort.
Before him in the moonlight he could see a
black mass rapidly taking shape. By its size and
general contour, as given him by the ex-slaves, he
conjectured that it must be the island of the big
cats.</p>

<p>He drifted nearer and nearer to it. Now he
was not more than a hundred feet away. Bomba
braced himself for the jar that would come when
the log struck the shore. Once more he looked
behind.</p>

<p>That look almost made his heart stop beating.</p>

<p>He saw a phosphorescent streak!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE HIDDEN LISTENER</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> knew all too well what that phosphorescent
streak meant. An alligator was coming,
and coming fast.</p>

<p>Bomba measured the distance between himself
and the shore. The log could move no faster
than the current. But Bomba could!</p>

<p>In an instant he had dived into the water and
struck out for the shore.</p>

<p>He could swim with amazing speed, and he
had never put such power into his strokes as he
did now. He knew that he was racing for his
life. Would the start he had prove sufficient to
bring him to the shore before he was overtaken
by his terrible pursuer?</p>

<p>It probably would not have been, if the monster
had not stopped for an instant and nosed
about the log. It was there its eyes had last
descried the boy, for Bomba had been swimming
under water since he had slipped off like a shadow.</p>

<p>That moment of puzzlement on the part of the
reptile proved the boy’s salvation. For by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
time Bomba’s almost bursting lungs compelled
him to come to the surface for air, he found himself
within a few strokes of the shore.</p>

<p>The alligator detected him and put on a tremendous
burst of speed. But it was under too
great a handicap. Bomba reached the bank and
pulled himself up just as the alligator made a
snap at him and missed.</p>

<p>Bomba rose to his feet, his heart swelling with
jubilation.</p>

<p>But that jubilation was swiftly turned to
horror.</p>

<p>As he drew the air into his gasping lungs and
turned from the shore, there came a tremendous
roar and the lad found himself looking into the
fiery eyes of a jaguar crouched for a spring.</p>

<p>There was no time to fit an arrow to the bow,
not even time to draw the machete from its
sheath, for even as Bomba’s startled mind grasped
the situation, the beast launched itself into the air.</p>

<p>Like a flash Bomba dropped flat to the ground.</p>

<p>He felt the rush of air as the brute passed over
him. The next instant Bomba was on his feet and
had drawn his knife, ready for the return attack.</p>

<p>But there was no need. They had been so
close to the bank that the spring of the brute had
carried it over the edge and into the water. It
came up sputtering and strangling and started to
scramble up the bank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>Then came a rush, a scream of mortal agony,
and the jaguar was struggling in the jaws of the
alligator!</p>

<p>The great beast fought desperately, tearing
with teeth and claws against the scaly hide of its
captor. But the alligator was in its favorite element
and had the advantage. Clamping the
jaguar in its great jaws, it went down under the
surface. There was a churning of the water that
rapidly turned red, a few bubbles of air rose to
the top, and then the commotion subsided.</p>

<p>The lord of the jungle had met more than his
match in the lord of the river!</p>

<p>Scarcely daring to believe in his escape, Bomba
watched the turbulent water in a horrid fascination.
Two terrible perils, one from the land, one
from the water, had vanished almost in the
twinkling of an eye.</p>

<p>He had reached his destination. He was on
Jaguar Island. He was unscathed. Surely the
Indians’ gods—or some power higher than his
own—must be on his side when one of his enemies
was made to destroy the other. The conviction
gave him renewed strength and courage.</p>

<p>He found a thorn thicket, forced his way into
it, and sat down to take counsel with himself as
to his future course.</p>

<p>He had formed no clear idea as yet as to how
he would approach Japazy. He had deferred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
thinking of that until he should have reached the
island.</p>

<p>One thing was certain. He must not seek him
at night. In the darkness and the confusion that
his unexpected coming might produce it might
very well happen that he would be killed before
his peaceful intentions could be explained. It was
the law of the jungle to shoot first and investigate
afterward.</p>

<p>No, he must go in the daylight, with his palms
extended outward as a sign of amity and goodwill.
Then he would be brought into Japazy’s
presence and would explain his errand. Then he
would listen to the words that would give him the
information for which his soul yearned or else
doom him once more to heartache and despair.</p>

<p>He looked at the sky and judged the time from
the position of the moon. It was not yet midnight.
He would have some hours in which to
get the rest that he so sorely needed. Then at
the first streak of dawn he would be astir, would
go scouting cautiously about the island and find
out the dwelling place of Japazy and his people.
After that he could decide how to approach the
half-breed.</p>

<p>The mysterious humming mixed with louder
and more discordant notes still persisted. Bomba
glanced riverward and saw the flickering lights<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
dancing weirdly on the surface. What did they
mean? What did they forebode?</p>

<p>He looked about the jungle. In the faint moonlight
that filtered through the trees the things he
saw took on fantastic shapes. The creepers
hanging from the trees swayed and writhed and
seemed to stretch out ghostly arms. The knots
and boles of the trunks framed themselves into
grimacing faces that seemed to be chuckling over
the fate of the young invader who had come unbidden
into their realm.</p>

<p>With an effort Bomba shook himself free from
the morbid fancies that were stealing upon him.</p>

<p>“Is Bomba an old woman?” he asked himself
scornfully. “Will he be whimpering soon like
Pipina, the squaw? No! Bomba does not fear
what the natives fear. He does not tremble like
Ashati and Neram who talk foolish words about
ghosts and demons. For Bomba is white. He
is like Gillis and Dorn, who laugh at the talk of
ghosts. If they can laugh, so can Bomba. For
Bomba has a white skin and he has a white soul,
and he is afraid of nothing that the foolish people
say walk in the darkness.”</p>

<p>Strengthened in his own mind by this defiance,
he took food from his pouch and made a hearty
meal. Then he burrowed still further into the
heart of the thicket, where, knowing that no wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
beast would attempt to get at him, he lay down
and slept.</p>

<p>The first faint light of day was creeping up the
sky when he awoke. He made a hasty breakfast,
and then, after looking closely to the condition
of his weapons, set out on his voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>It was not long before he discovered that the
island was many acres in extent. Much of it was
jungle, almost as thick in places as on the mainland.
But it was much easier to traverse, for
there were numerous well-beaten trails extending
in various directions which attested the presence
of quite an island population.</p>

<p>There were sections also on which grew little
vegetation. These were sandy and rocky plateaus,
seamed with ravines. There was one great
hill that almost rose to the dignity of a mountain,
and from this a bluish vapor or smoke kept constantly
rising and spreading out in the shape of a
fan. At times a flash of flame would issue forth
from the summit.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of this, Bomba frequently felt
slight tremors of the earth, one of them so pronounced
that it nearly threw him from his feet.
And the humming was much louder here than it
had been when Bomba was on the river.</p>

<p>Bomba knew that he was in a volcanic region,
and the discovery did not contribute to his peace
of mind. The terrible scenes that had attended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the eruption of the Moving Mountain and the
earthquake that had accompanied it were still too
fresh in his memory not to stir him unpleasantly
in retrospect.</p>

<p>At almost every moment Bomba expected to
come upon some hut or village in the jungle.
From the inhabitants of these, he had planned to
get information as to the village or town in which
Japazy dwelt. But though he saw once in a
while some ramshackle cabin, it proved invariably
to be deserted. In some places the lush vegetation
of the jungle had almost overgrown the hut.
No beaten path led to the door. Not the rudest
of native furniture was within.</p>

<p>After two or three experiences of this kind
Bomba grasped the situation. The jaguars that
had given the island its name must abound in
such numbers that no solitary dweller in the jungle
would be safe. Probably every one of these
deserted cabins had been the scene of a tragedy.
Undoubtedly the inhabitants had had to gather
into one town for mutual protection.</p>

<p>Bomba thanked his stars that it was daylight
and that most of the nocturnal prowlers had
retired to their dens where they would sleep the
day away in preparation for the next foray. But
all the same, there might be one or more about,
and he kept a vigilant eye upon every tree and
thicket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>He had searched about for perhaps three hours
when he heard the twang of a bow string. With
it was blended a roar of rage and pain. Then
followed an excited babbling of voices.</p>

<p>The sound had come from the further side of
a group of rocks that seemed to have been thrown
about in confusion by some convulsion of nature.
They were not more than fifty yards away.</p>

<p>With the speed and at the same time the
stealthiness of a panther, Bomba glided to the
biggest group of bowlders. He squeezed himself
in a crevice between two of them.</p>

<p>Now he could hear the voices of two natives
talking vociferously.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>DISCOVERED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span> edged himself still further between the
bowlders until he found a place where he could
look through without himself being seen.</p>

<p>At once he saw the reason of the excitement.</p>

<p>A dead jaguar lay stretched out on the ground.
One arrow protruded from its side. Another was
imbedded in its throat.</p>

<p>Two natives were inspecting it and gloating
over their kill. They were vigorous and stalwart
specimens, somewhat above the usual size of jungle
dwellers. Their faces were savage, but not
so brutish as those of the headhunters of Nascanora.
They were unclothed, save for the customary
breech clout. On their broad breasts was
painted a tribal emblem that Bomba had never
seen, and a band about the forehead of each
held a cluster of nodding plumes.</p>

<p>While the language in which they spoke had
some words that were unfamiliar to Bomba, he
was so well versed in most of the dialects of the
jungle, which differ little, that he had no trouble
in understanding what they were saying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“The aim of Sunka is true,” boasted one, as
he bent over the dead beast and proceeded, with
the aid of his knife to get the arrow from its
throat.</p>

<p>“No truer than that of Boshot,” retorted the
other, as he sought to reclaim his arrow from the
body. “See how it went through from side to
side!”</p>

<p>“The jaguar is brave, but he is not so brave as
the fighting men of Japazy,” went on Sunka, as
he examined his arrow, dried it and returned it to
his quiver.</p>

<p>“His leap is as the lightning, but when the arrow
sings he falls,” added Boshot. “I see Olura,
Tama and Abino coming,” he went on, as he
looked toward a trail at his right.</p>

<p>“They have heard the jaguar roar and they
come to help,” declared Sunka. “But there is no
need of help when Sunka and Boshot have fitted
their arrows to the string.”</p>

<p>It was in this self-congratulatory mood that the
victors welcomed the three newcomers whom
Bomba could now see issuing from the jungle
path.</p>

<p>There were loud cries of satisfaction as the trio
discovered the dead body of the jaguar.</p>

<p>“Japazy will be glad when he sees its head!”
exclaimed Olura, as he surveyed the animal.</p>

<p>“Whose arrow killed it?” asked Tama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Mine,” declared Sunka proudly.</p>

<p>“Mine,” stated Boshot with equal conviction.</p>

<p>They glared at each other in defiance, and
their hands involuntarily gripped more tightly the
spears that they carried in addition to their bows
and arrows.</p>

<p>“There is no need of bad blood and hot words
between Sunka and Boshot,” intervened Abino,
who seemed to be much older than the others and
something of a diplomat. “All Japazy’s people
know how brave they are. What matter which
arrow did the killing? Neither might have done
so without the other. Japazy will be pleased with
Sunka and Boshot. But his eyes will shoot lightning
at either one, if he fight with the other.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” put in Tama. “There are too
few of our people now since the plague came some
moons ago. That plague carried many to the
place of the dead. The tribe needs all its fighting
men to kill jaguars and not to kill each other.”</p>

<p>The hands of the would-be combatants loosened
from their spears and their anger disappeared.
Bomba guessed that the most potent argument
had been the mention of the lightning that would
flash from Japazy’s eyes. It was evident from
the reverence with which they pronounced the
name of the chief that they held him in awe.</p>

<p>“The jaguar is dead, and that is good,” said
Abino. “But there are still many left. We kill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
many, but more come. And there are cubs in the
caves that will soon be big enough to carry off the
children of the tribe.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Olura, with despondency in his
tone. “Two more were carried off last week. The
medicine men make prayers, but still the jaguars
come.”</p>

<p>“They come from the other shore,” observed
Abino. “They swim the river in the night when
the caymans are asleep. There are herbs on the
island that they like, that make them laugh when
they are sad, that make them well when they are
sick.”</p>

<p>Bomba guessed that they referred to a kind of
catnip that he had already noted growing on the
island in great profusion. He wondered that
the natives had not torn these up by the roots, so
as to make the place less alluring to the unwelcome
visitors. Then, realizing the rank and
rapid growth of the vegetation, he knew that
nothing less than an army could accomplish the
colossal task.</p>

<p>“It would be well if Japazy would take his people
to the other side of the river where the jaguars
are not so many and where the tribe could
dwell in peace,” remarked Boshot.</p>

<p>“Beware, Boshot,” warned Abino, looking
fearfully about him. “Remember you not Manasta,
he of the bold and forward tongue? He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
said one day to Japazy the words that just now
came from Boshot’s mouth. Japazy looked at
him and his frown was terrible. And Manasta
has not been seen since that day.”</p>

<p>“That is true,” put in Tama, in an awed voice.
“It is said that Japazy had him tied and put in a
bag and thrown into the river to the caymans. So
beware, Boshot. They are good words that Abino
has spoken to Boshot.”</p>

<p>The doughty warrior, who had not quailed before
the charge of the jaguar, seemed to shrink
into himself, and Bomba had a new glimpse into
the ruthless character with whom he was soon to
deal.</p>

<p>“Now let us skin the jaguar and get his meat,”
suggested Olura. “There is but little food in the
huts of our people, and they will be glad and make
a feast when they see us bringing them the meat
of the jaguar.”</p>

<p>They were preparing to carry out the suggestion
when there was a sharp report. A burst of
flame sprang out of the mountain’s top, and the
earth shook so violently that all of the natives
measured their length upon the ground. Bomba
would have been thrown also, had it not been
for the rocks on either side. As it was, he was
knocked about until he was bruised and sore.</p>

<p>The natives scrambled to their knees and
bowed their heads to the ground, making cabalistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
signs and uttering entreaties either to the
mountain or their gods.</p>

<p>The trembling of the earth persisted for several
minutes and then subsided. But it was some time
before the natives had so far recovered from their
fright as to set about resuming the skinning and
cutting up of the dead jaguar.</p>

<p>“Tamura is angry,” murmured Abino, looking
up fearfully at the mountain peak, from which
smoke and flame were still issuing. “We must
make him gifts, many gifts, so that he may smile
again upon our people.”</p>

<p>“We will give some of this meat to the medicine
man so that he may make a burnt offering,”
suggested Tama. “Else the lava floods may come
and roll over the dwelling place of the tribe.”</p>

<p>As though to accentuate this possibility, there
came another shock more violent than the one
before.</p>

<p>The rocks between which Bomba was standing
were pulled apart as though by giant hands, and
to the startled eyes of the Indians Bomba stood
revealed!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>IN THE HANDS OF THE TRIBE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> effect created by the sudden appearance
of Bomba was startling.</p>

<p>For a moment the savages gaped at him in
stupefaction, eyes bulging, jaws dropped. Then
some of them raised their spears and others
hastily fitted arrows to their bows.</p>

<p>Bomba had been almost as disconcerted by his
sudden betrayal as the natives themselves. But
now, as steadily as the tremulous motion of the
earth would permit, he stepped boldly out of his
former hiding place with hands up and palms extended,
as a token that he came in amity and
goodwill.</p>

<p>The sign was one that was understood by all
tribes that dwelt in the jungle, and the threatening
motions ceased. Spears and bows were lowered
and the natives stood looking at him in
wonder. His bronzed skin was almost as dark
as theirs, but they knew by his features that he
belonged to a different race.</p>

<p>Not a word was uttered until Abino, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
seemed to be the spokesman of the group, took a
step forward.</p>

<p>“Who is the stranger?” he asked. “Why has
he come to the island of Japazy?”</p>

<p>“It is Bomba who speaks,” replied the lad.
“He comes from a far part of the jungle and
he would speak to Japazy, your chief. He comes
in peace. His heart is clean and he does not
speak in forked words.”</p>

<p>“It is well that the stranger comes in peace,”
returned Abino, “for the spears of Japazy’s
fighting men are sharp and their arrows sing with
joy when they sink into the heart of an enemy.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” grunted Boshot. “The men of Japazy
would not waste an arrow on a boy.”</p>

<p>The slur stung Bomba, but he knew the importance
of keeping his temper, and no change
of expression was visible in his face. Still, he
thought it might be just as well to let them know
at the outset that though he was a boy he was
no weakling.</p>

<p>“Bomba is but a boy,” he admitted, with an
ingratiating smile. “But Bomba has the muscles
of a man. He will show you.”</p>

<p>He walked up to the dead jaguar, put his arm
under it, and with one mighty heave threw it over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>There were excited exclamations among the
Indians, and they shrank back, looking at Bomba<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
in awe. Not one of them, despite their size,
could have performed the feat so easily, if at all.</p>

<p>“The stranger is strong,” admitted Abino, and
Boshot looked rather sheepish because of his
slighting remark.</p>

<p>Bomba noted the impression that had been
produced and thought it an opportune time to
deepen it still further.</p>

<p>“Bomba is no weakling,” he said; “but the
weapons he carries with him are stronger than
Bomba. His arrows go far and they go straight.
They find the eye of the cayman and the heart of
the jaguar.”</p>

<p>“The stranger speaks big words,” retorted
Sunka skeptically.</p>

<p>Bomba looked about him. At a distance of
two hundred feet was a high tree, on the topmost
branch of which a buzzard was preening itself.</p>

<p>“The buzzard is far away,” he said, as he
fitted an arrow to his string, “but he will fall
when Bomba lets go the string.”</p>

<p>There were grunts of incredulity mingled with
curiosity. This stranger was giving them thrills
to which they were unaccustomed.</p>

<p>“Shall Bomba’s arrow strike the body or the
neck?” asked Bomba with a show of indifference.</p>

<p>“Now we know that the stranger boasts,”
broke in Tama. “If he hit the body, he will do
well.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“It will be the neck,” declared Bomba.</p>

<p>The arrow sang through the air and the buzzard
fell, transfixed by the arrow lodged in its
neck.</p>

<p>Again there was an outburst of excited exclamations.
The natives had never seen such shooting.</p>

<p>“That is but little,” said Bomba, satisfied with
the impression he had produced. “Bomba has a
fire stick in his pouch that speaks with the voice
of thunder, and when it speaks something dies.
But he will not show it now.”</p>

<p>The Indians looked at him with awe. Gone
was the half contempt with which they had at
first regarded him. No such boy had ever been
seen in those parts before. In their superstitious
minds was the vague, confused impression that
perhaps he was one of the gods.</p>

<p>“Bomba would see Japazy,” went on the lad.
“He has come from a far country to speak with
him. Perhaps the warriors of his tribe will show
Bomba where the chief dwells?”</p>

<p>They looked at each other questioningly.</p>

<p>“He is a bold man who would speak with
Japazy,” said Abino. “Japazy does not like
strangers. Some have been cast on the island
from the river, and they have never gone back to
speak of the island of the big cats. They have
gone to the place of the dead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>This had not an auspicious sound, and Bomba
for a moment felt an uncomfortable chill creeping
up his spine.</p>

<p>“Bomba has no evil thought in his mind,” the
lad rejoined. “He does not seek any of Japazy’s
goods, and he will not say anything that will bring
harm to Japazy or his people. He would only
ask a question of Japazy.”</p>

<p>His hearers still looked extremely dubious, and
Bomba thought that he could detect pity in some
of the glances directed toward him.</p>

<p>“It is not for Japazy’s people to know what is
in the mind of their chief,” said Abino. “Japazy
does as he wills and his words mean life or death.”</p>

<p>“He will speak life for Bomba,” replied the
lad, with an assumption of confidence that he was
a long way from feeling. “Will Japazy’s fighting
men take Bomba to their chief?”</p>

<p>They drew apart and conferred together. It
was evident that even this simple request required
thought before it could be granted. Bomba could
see that, if Japazy resented his coming, his wrath
might fall upon those who had brought the unwelcome
stranger to his presence instead of killing
him on the spot.</p>

<p>There was an animated discussion that at times
almost reached the dimensions of a quarrel. But
at last they came to a conclusion and Abino turned
toward Bomba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“The stranger shall go to Japazy,” he announced.
“But he must have his hands bound so
that he may do no harm to Japazy or his people.”</p>

<p>Bomba took a step backward.</p>

<p>“Bomba is free,” he said proudly. “It is not
meet that he have his hands bound as though he
were a slave. His hands will do no hurt to Japazy
or the people of his tribe. Bomba’s heart is
good. Has he not said that he came in peace?
May the curse of the gods rest on Bomba, if he
means harm.”</p>

<p>His earnestness seemed to make an impression,
but still the tribesmen hesitated.</p>

<p>“The stranger then must give up his bow and
his knife and the fire stick that speaks with the
voice of thunder,” suggested Abino, as a compromise.</p>

<p>But Bomba shook his head.</p>

<p>“The bow, the knife and the fire stick are
Bomba’s friends,” he declared. “Without them
he would be like a man without arms and legs.
They will do harm to no one but the wicked.
Bomba will keep his friends.”</p>

<p>They could have fallen upon him and overpowered
him by sheer weight of numbers. But
they had seen a demonstration of his skill and
knew that he would take toll of some of them
before he succumbed. Any one who could shoot
a buzzard through the neck at two hundred feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and sling a jaguar over his shoulders, was to be
treated with respect. And doubtless the mention
of the fire stick that spoke with the voice of
thunder had been extremely potent.</p>

<p>Again there was a discussion and again the
Indians yielded the point in question.</p>

<p>“It shall be as the stranger wills,” announced
Abino. “The warriors of Japazy will skin the
jaguar and take its meat and then they will lead
the stranger to the place where Japazy dwells.”</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Bomba, with more relief than
he allowed to appear. “The men of Japazy have
good hearts.”</p>

<p>The men set to work on the jaguar, and Bomba
helped them. The dexterity and sureness with
which he wielded his knife contributed still further
to the respect the Indians had conceived for
him.</p>

<p>When the work was finished the men lifted up
their respective burdens and led the way, with
Bomba bringing up the rear. He did not think
that any treachery was intended, for Abino, somehow,
had given him an impression of sincerity.
But he was on the alert and ready for instant
action at any suspicious movement, for his life in
the jungle had taught him to take no chances.</p>

<p>Nothing untoward developed, however, and
before long they came to the straggling outskirts
of a village that seemed to have a considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
population. From every hut, as the little procession
moved along, people poured out with exclamations
of curiosity as they stared at the
stranger who should have been a captive and yet
walked behind the rest more with the air of a
conqueror.</p>

<p>Most of the houses were of the usual native
cabin type, but in the center of the town was a
building of so much greater pretensions that
Bomba concluded it must be the dwelling of
Japazy.</p>

<p>Abino led Bomba to a little cabin not far from
the palace, if it could be dignified by that name,
and left him there with the promise that he would
see Japazy and return.</p>

<p>He did return in less than five minutes.</p>

<p>“Japazy is gone!” he declared abruptly.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>DAZZLING TREASURE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Something</span> like a stab pierced Bomba’s heart
when he heard Abino make the announcement
that Japazy was gone.</p>

<p>“Gone?” he cried, springing to his feet.
“Japazy gone? Has Bomba come so far through
the jungle only to find that Japazy is not on the
island of the big cats? Where has he gone?
When will he be back?”</p>

<p>“Abino does not know,” was the answer.
“Japazy goes when and where he will. He does
not ask counsel of the elders of the tribe. It is
enough that he wants to go. But he does not
stay away long. The stranger will have to wait.”</p>

<p>“Has he gone away from Jaguar Island, or is
he going about among his people in the other
villages?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“There is no village but this,” replied Abino.
“Once there were many on the island, but the big
cats have come and killed so many of the people
that they have all come together in this place so
that they will be safe. The big cats do not come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
where they are so many fighting men. No, Japazy
is not on the island. He has gone away over the
water.”</p>

<p>The sunken city of which Hondura had spoken
came into Bomba’s mind.</p>

<p>“Is it that he has gone to the place where stood
the city that had towers of gold?” he asked.</p>

<p>A startling change came into Abino’s tone and
manner. His glance seemed to bore Bomba
through and through.</p>

<p>“What foolish words are these that the
stranger speaks?” he demanded sharply. “There
is no city that has towers of gold. It is not well
to ask too many questions. Men have asked questions
of Japazy, and he has cut out their tongues.
If the stranger is wise, he will let others speak
while he listens. Abino has spoken.”</p>

<p>Bomba realized that he had touched upon a
forbidden subject. For some reason, the sunken
city was a secret that was jealously guarded. He
resolved to be discreet.</p>

<p>“Abino speaks wise words,” he said placatingly.
“Bomba will keep them in his heart. He
will wait in patience till Japazy returns.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” returned Abino, mollified.
“Bomba shall have food and drink and none shall
harm him. And he shall have a place to sleep in
the house of Japazy until the chief comes back
from his journey. Bomba can come now and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Abino will take him to the place where he shall
stay.”</p>

<p>Bomba rose and followed his guide. His appearance
outside was again the signal for an outpouring
of the curious. There had been time
now for the warriors who had first met this
stranger to spread abroad the story of his strength
and skill, and there was manifest respect in the
fact that, while they followed him, they were
careful not to come too close. Who of them
knew but that this youth who boasted of a fire
stick that spoke like thunder might be a god?</p>

<p>Under other circumstances Bomba’s pride
would have been gratified by this tribute. But
his whole thought was centered now on the disappearance
of Japazy. This had not entered into
his calculations. He bitterly regretted that he
had not come sooner. Suppose Japazy never
came back? Life was a precarious thing in this
part of the world. Usually it hung by a thread.
The bite of a snake, the spring of a jaguar, and
Japazy’s lips might be sealed forever. Then
Bomba’s last hope of learning the secret of his
parentage would have vanished.</p>

<p>The crowd halted at the entrance to Japazy’s
great dwelling. Evidently it was forbidden
ground except to the chosen few, such as Abino,
who, as Bomba learned later, was Japazy’s chief
counselor and who had charge of all matters pertaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
to the tribe during his master’s absence.</p>

<p>Followed by Bomba alone, Abino led the way
through a massive door, well furnished with bars
and bolts to protect its owner in case of invasion
or revolt. And once inside, Bomba saw a sight
that fairly dazzled him.</p>

<p>He had never been in any house but a native
hut, with its rude and scanty furniture. He had
expected to see something more elaborate in the
dwelling of Japazy. But he was by no means
prepared for the splendor that burst upon him.</p>

<p>There were objects here that might have
graced any palace in Europe. Beautiful paintings
hung on the walls. Sumptuous rugs covered the
floors. Splendid chairs and divans were scattered
here and there. Silken tapestries hung as portières
at the entrances of various rooms that
opened from the main hall. There were statues
of marble, tables cunningly carved and inlaid with
gold and precious stones, curious medallions and
intaglios, suits of armor and swords of the finest
steel, a vast number of objects of art of all kinds
scattered about in profusion.</p>

<p>Bomba had never seen anything of the kind,
never dreamed of them, never known that they
existed. It was as though he had been translated
to another world.</p>

<p>Where had these things come from? How had
they been secured?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Then light flashed upon Bomba. They must
have come from that city of which Hondura had
spoken, the city whose very towers had been of
gold! Somehow, Japazy had found access to that
city—or what was left of it. No wonder that he
guarded his secret so jealously!</p>

<p>Bomba had no knowledge of values. He had
never seen money. But he knew vaguely that
here was something infinitely precious, infinitely
desirable. And the white blood in him, with its
inheritance of taste and culture and love of the
beautiful, as well as the little knowledge of wider
things that Casson, before that devastating gun
explosion, had given him, told him that he was
in a treasure house.</p>

<p>Were things like these, he asked himself, the
things that white people had in the homes and
cities that Frank Parkhurst had told him about?
Were they things that he, Bomba, might have,
if he were living with the race to which he belonged?</p>

<p>He stole a glance at Abino. The savage was
standing there stolidly, indifferently, in a bored
attitude. Bomba sensed that the man had not
the slightest appreciation of the beauty by which
he was surrounded. He had the soul of a native
of the jungle, incapable of being touched by anything
but the most primitive needs of life.</p>

<p>But why should Japazy then appreciate and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
collect them? The explanation dawned on
Bomba. Japazy was a half-breed. Some of his
blood was white. And Sobrinini had known Japazy
when they were both parts of that faraway
country where the white people dwelt. So Japazy
had learned what beauty was, and the part of him
that was white had yearned for these things! He
had gathered them from the sunken city, where
once a great civilization had flourished, and had
furnished his dwelling with the splendor of the
distant white civilization.</p>

<p>Bomba felt an increased respect for the chief
he had come to see. Part of the blood, anyway,
of this man was white. And were not all white
men brothers? Would not Japazy feel a touch
of kinship and give him freely the information
that he sought?</p>

<p>It never occurred to Bomba that in giving Japazy
credit for taste and a love of beauty for its
own sake he might be paying too high a tribute
to the half-breed. That the latter should be collecting
these things for mercenary purposes with
the design, when he should have enough, of shipping
them overseas and selling them at fabulous
prices, and then following them to live for the
rest of his life in wealth and luxury amid the
civilization whose value he knew, did not enter
Bomba’s mind.</p>

<p>In the center of the largest room stood a platform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
covered with a cloth of scarlet and gold,
and on this was a great carved chair that doubtless
served Japazy as a throne. Bomba could
figure the half-breed sitting there, stern and commanding,
clothed in gorgeous raiment the better
to emphasize the distance between him and his
dependents who bowed cringingly before him.</p>

<p>Abino seemed to realize what Bomba was
thinking, and he answered the unspoken question.</p>

<p>“It is from here that Japazy rules his people,”
said Abino in tones of reverence. “Here he
speaks the words that mean life or death. It is
here that the stranger will stand when he is
brought in to where Japazy waits to hear him.”</p>

<p>Words that mean life or death! Which of the
two would they mean to him, Bomba wondered.</p>

<p>“Come,” said Abino, “and Abino will show
you the place where you are to stay.”</p>

<p>He led him to a room at some distance from
that large central hall and motioned him to enter.</p>

<p>In contrast to the other room, it was very simply
and plainly furnished. Still, it was in the
style of the white people, with chairs and table,
a rug on the floor and a bed with a mattress,
sheets and coverings.</p>

<p>Bomba felt strange and abashed. He had
never sat on a chair, never slept in a bed. But he
restrained his feelings in the presence of Abino.
After all, he was white, and his heart swelled at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
the thought. This would be his chance to do as
white folks did, sit on a chair, sleep in a bed, try
to imagine by so doing that he was getting a little
closer to his own people for whom his heart
yearned. When he did find them he did not want
to have them ashamed of him.</p>

<p>“It is in this room that people stay who come
from afar to have talk with Japazy,” Abino remarked.
“Some of them, after he has heard their
words, go away again. But some do not go
away.”</p>

<p>The last words had an ominous ring and were
not calculated to add to Bomba’s peace of mind.
But he gave no sign, and a look of admiration
that the native could not repress came into Abino’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“The stranger is brave,” he said. “His arms
are strong and his eye is straight. Abino does
not forget how the stranger slung the jaguar over
his shoulder and how he shot his arrow through
the neck of the buzzard on the top of the tall
tree. But it is not enough for one who stands
before Japazy to have strong arms and a straight
eye. He must have a heart that does not tremble.”</p>

<p>“Is Japazy then so terrible?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p>“The stranger shall see for himself,” answered
Abino. “Japazy’s eyes shoot lightnings. His
voice is like the thunder. No arrow can pierce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
him, no knife can bite him. For he has ghosts and
demons that obey his words. They turn aside the
arrows. They dull the edge of the knife. But
it is not well to talk of Japazy. The stranger will
rest here and Abino will send him food. Then,
after he has eaten, the elders of the tribe will
come and talk with him.”</p>

<p>“They are good words that Abino speaks,”
answered the lad. “Bomba will be glad to talk
to the elders of the tribe and tell them why he
has come to Jaguar Island.”</p>

<p>Abino withdrew, and Bomba welcomed the
chance to be alone. He had been under a terrific
strain, mentally and physically. Now he could
relax for a while before he had to brace himself
again for the interview that was coming.</p>

<p>His eyes, glancing around the room, caught
sight of a picture on the wall. At the sight his
heart almost leaped from his body.</p>

<p>The pictured face of the portrait was that of
the same lovely woman who had looked down at
him from the portrait in the dwelling of Sobrinini!</p>

<small>THE DEEPENING MYSTERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> one bound Bomba was across the room
and looking at the picture with all his soul in his
eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the same beautiful face, girlish and
appealing, the soft hair waving back from the
broad forehead, the half-smiling lips, the eyes
that were dark and melting. And the eyes looked
down at him now as they had looked at him in
the hut of Sobrinini, full of love and tenderness,
while the lips seemed ready to murmur words of
endearment.</p>

<p>What chords of memory did that face stir in
Bomba’s heart? What recollections, faint and
dim as some far off strains of music, were tugging
at his consciousness? What vague memory told
that desolate lad that he was looking at the pictured
face of his mother?</p>

<p>His mother! The mother who perhaps had
sung to him the lullaby that Sobrinini had crooned,
who once perhaps had caressed him, kissed him,
called him Bonny, her Bonny!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>A passion of tears welled to the boy’s eyes.
His heart was stirred to its depths.</p>

<p>But he dashed the tears away. A native might
enter at any minute and might attribute them to
weakness, to fear at the situation in which he
found himself. Above everything, he must remain
master of himself.</p>

<p>How came that picture in the dwelling of Japazy,
the half-breed? Why had a similar picture
been in the hut of Sobrinini? What mysterious
link was there between the lovely original of that
picture and Sobrinini, the witch woman, Japazy,
the master of Jaguar Island, Jojasta, the medicine
man of the Moving Mountain, and Casson,
his friend and former protector? Somewhere,
some time, those residents of the Amazonian jungle
had known the mysterious Bartow, his wife,
Laura, and perhaps the little child named Bonny.
How had fate brought them together? And how
had fate torn them apart?</p>

<p>The door of his room opened, and a boy appeared,
bringing a tray of food. It was savory
and abundant, and Bomba ate it with a relish.</p>

<p>The boy, who seemed to be about twelve years
old, stood by, watching him with black, beadlike
eyes. Curiosity was in the eyes and awe, awe
of this bold stranger, only a little older than himself
in years, but vastly older in strength and experience,
who had dared to take his life in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
hands and come to ask questions of the dreaded
Japazy, the lord of life and death on Jaguar
Island.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Bomba, who took
a liking to the youngster.</p>

<p>“Thy servant’s name is Solani,” answered the
boy. “He is the son of Abino.”</p>

<p>“Solani has a good father,” said Bomba diplomatically.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the boy proudly. “There is
no one so wise on the island of the big cats as
Abino, except Japazy himself.”</p>

<p>“Has Solani ever seen ghosts or demons?”
asked Bomba. “It is said that there are many
on the island.”</p>

<p>The boy looked about fearfully.</p>

<p>“There are many here,” he answered. “They
keep Japazy from harm. But no one can see
them except Japazy. His eyes see everything.”</p>

<p>“Bomba saw some lights on the river,” said the
jungle boy, determined to draw Solani out, for he
saw that he was in a responsive mood. “Bomba
did not know but what the lights were the campfires
of the ghosts.”</p>

<p>“The lights are burning brushwood,” explained
Solani. “They are thrown out from the earth
when Tamura, the mountain, is angry and his
anger breaks great holes in the ground.”</p>

<p>“Is Tamura often angry?” asked Bomba.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Many times he speaks in thunder and throws
out rocks and rivers of fire that eat up whatever
they touch,” replied Solani. “Tamura has killed
many of our people. The old men say that he
will not be silent until some stranger is offered
up to him. Then he will be satisfied and make no
more thunder.”</p>

<p>As Bomba, as far as he knew, was the only
stranger at that time on the island, there was
something decidedly uncomfortable in this information.</p>

<p>At this moment Abino entered, followed by
several old men whom Bomba took to be the chief
advisers of the tribe.</p>

<p>Abino motioned to his son to take away the
empty dishes and what food remained, and then
he and his companions squatted on their haunches
in a semicircle and gazed fixedly at Bomba.</p>

<p>They said nothing, and their stare persisted so
long that Bomba became restless and himself
broke the silence.</p>

<p>“It was good of Abino to send Bomba food,”
he said. “There was much food and it was good.”</p>

<p>“The stranger must not starve until Japazy
hears what words the stranger has to say to him,”
replied Abino.</p>

<p>“They will not be many words,” replied Bomba.
“They will not make Japazy shoot lightnings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
from his eyes. Bomba comes in peace and his
words are good words.”</p>

<p>“What are the words that the stranger would
speak with Japazy?” asked one of the most aged
and wizened of his visitors.</p>

<p>Bomba hesitated. Would Japazy resent his
confiding his mission to any one but himself?</p>

<p>On the other hand, he had already gotten some
useful information from Solani. The mention of
human sacrifices, for instance, had put him on his
guard, if, in the future, any such thing should be
attempted. Perhaps in conversation with these
elders of the tribe he might learn something else
that might be of value to him.</p>

<p>Moreover they had asked him the question,
and any lack of frankness on his part might
deepen the suspicion they already entertained as
to his motives.</p>

<p>He decided to answer.</p>

<p>“Bomba would ask Japazy who are the father
and mother of Bomba and how he can find them
if they are still alive,” the lad stated.</p>

<p>Bomba caught the quick glances that passed
between the Indians at this announcement, and
he was not unaware of the look that Abino flashed
at the picture of the lovely woman on the wall.</p>

<p>“Why does the stranger think that Japazy can
tell him who his father and mother are?” asked
Abino, after a pause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“Sobrinini told Bomba that Japazy knew,” returned
Bomba.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini!” exclaimed one of his auditors.
“She is the witch woman who dwells on the island
of snakes. To go to that island is death. How,
then, does the stranger say that he has had speech
with Sobrinini?”</p>

<p>“Bomba’s tongue is not forked,” replied the
lad. “Bomba went to the island of snakes and
had speech with the witch woman. Then he took
her away from the island and gave her shelter in
the hut of Bomba and the good white man, Casson.”</p>

<p>“Why did not Sobrinini tell the stranger of his
father and mother?” asked his questioner incredulously.</p>

<p>“Sobrinini tried to tell, but the gods had put
clouds on her mind and she could not see through
them,” answered Bomba. “But she could see
Japazy through the clouds and she said he would
know. So Bomba is here.”</p>

<p>The promptness and sincerity of his answers
evidently had some effect on his visitors. They
looked at each other uncertainly. Then the eldest
of them spoke.</p>

<p>“There is much gold on the island of the big
cats,” he said slowly. “Strangers have come here
before, and their words were as smooth as the
skin of the baby and as sweet as honey in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
comb. But they said one thing with their tongue
and another in their heart. The demons that
guard Japazy told him what word was in the
stranger’s heart; and that word was gold. The
strangers did not go away again from the island
of the big cats.”</p>

<p>“Bomba has not two ways of speaking,” answered
the lad. “The words from his lips are
the same as the words in his heart. Bomba does
not care for the gold of Japazy. He would not
know what to do with it if Japazy gave it to him.
May the gods lay their curse on Bomba if he is
not speaking from a clean heart!”</p>

<p>Another long pause ensued.</p>

<p>“Is it true that the stranger does not even know
the name of his father or that of his mother?”
asked one of the group.</p>

<p>“Bomba does not surely know,” returned the
lad. “But when Sobrinini saw Bomba she called
him Bartow. And Jojasta of the Moving Mountain
called him Bartow. They thought Bomba
was Bartow or Bartow’s ghost. So if Bomba
looked so much like Bartow, it may be that Bartow
was Bomba’s father. And Sobrinini spoke of
Laura. And Casson spoke of Laura. It is in
Bomba’s heart that that may have been the name
of his mother.”</p>

<p>Was it fancy, or did Abino again steal a glance
at that picture on the wall?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“It is well,” said the oldest of the group as he
rose to his feet, an example followed by the others.
“We will think over what the stranger has said.”</p>

<p>The old men went out of the room silently, in
single file. But the silence persisted only until
they had gone some distance down the corridor
that led to the large hall. Then they broke out
into excited speech.</p>

<p>Bomba would have given a great deal to know
what they were saying, but they were too far
away for him to hear them distinctly.</p>

<p>After they had gone out of the door of the
building, however, their way led them under his
window. They were still talking excitedly, and,
as he strained his ears, these words floated up
to him:</p>

<p>“Bartow! Was not that the name of the man
Japazy killed?”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>THE CREEPING DEATH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Bomba</span>, his head in a whirl, staggered back
from the window when he heard the sinister
words:</p>

<p>“Was not that the name of the man Japazy
killed?”</p>

<p>Was it possible that the father whom he had
sought so long was really dead? Had all his
search been futile?</p>

<p>But the despair that this thought brought him
was quickly swallowed up by another emotion.
Rage, blinding rage, at the man who had killed his
father, at Japazy, the half-breed, the arrogant,
heartless monster who lorded it over this ignorant
people.</p>

<p>If this should prove true—that Japazy was
really his father’s murderer—Bomba then and
there vowed vengeance. Let Japazy look to himself!
Let him gather all his ghosts and demons
to protect him! They would be of no avail.
Bomba’s arrow or Bomba’s knife would find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
black heart of the half-breed! His father’s murder
should be avenged!</p>

<p>Bomba knew nothing of the Christian law of
forgiveness. He had been brought up in the jungle,
whose first law was self-preservation, whose
second law was vengeance for evil received. If
Japazy had taken Bartow’s life, Japazy’s life
must pay the forfeit.</p>

<p>Oh, if Japazy were only here! Oh, if Bomba
could meet him face to face and wrest the truth
from him! The lad paced the room, gnashing his
teeth with impatience.</p>

<p>His restless pacings brought him beneath the
lovely pictured face on the wall. He gazed at it
yearningly. If she were his mother, perhaps she
still lived, even if his father was dead.</p>

<p>Then another thought came to him and his
rage flamed up anew. Perhaps she, too, had
fallen a victim to Japazy. The hand that slew
the one might also have slain the other. In that
case, Bomba would owe a double debt of vengeance.
And he would pay that debt!</p>

<p>Oh, if he only knew!</p>

<p>But there was nothing he could do until Japazy
returned.</p>

<p>Suppose, however, that Japazy did not return?
What if any one of the thousand perils of the
jungle should cut short his life? Then perhaps
Bomba could never get the knowledge for which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
his soul panted. He would be cheated, too, of
his vengeance—supposing it were true that Japazy
had indeed slain his father.</p>

<p>Even while immersed in these gloomy reflections,
a gleam of hope came to Bomba.</p>

<p>Abino!</p>

<p>Perhaps Abino knew. He was the chosen
counselor of Japazy as far as that haughty despot
permitted any one to advise him. Perhaps he was
also the repository of Japazy’s secrets. Those
quick and furtive glances that Abino had cast at
the picture on the wall! What did they mean?
What did Abino know?</p>

<p>Tired out finally by these ponderings and questionings,
Bomba at last threw himself on the floor
and slept. And for this he chose a place directly
beneath the picture, where those lovely, tender
eyes could look down upon him.</p>

<p>It was dark when he woke, and the immediate
occasion of his waking was the entrance of Solani,
bringing his supper.</p>

<p>The boy lighted a torch and thrust it into a
holder against the wall. By its light, Bomba
noted that the boy looked disturbed and
frightened.</p>

<p>“Solani is sad to-night,” observed Bomba, as he
prepared to eat the meal that the lad had set on
the table. “What is it that makes the heart of
Solani heavy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>The boy looked about him carefully, and when
he answered, it was almost in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Solani grieves because he fears that harm may
come to the stranger,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Who would bring harm to Bomba, except perhaps
Japazy?” asked the jungle lad. “And Japazy
is not here. Unless Japazy has come since
you brought the last meat to Bomba,” he added.</p>

<p>“Japazy is not here,” replied Solani. “But the
people of the tribe are fearful of his wrath if he
should come and find the stranger here. They
think that Japazy will not be glad to hear the
stranger’s words about his father and his mother.
They fear that Japazy may be angry because they
did not kill the stranger as soon as he landed on
Jaguar Island.”</p>

<p>Bomba’s heart sank. Was it possible that the
elders, believing that Japazy had killed the boy’s
father, were fearful that he had come to take
vengeance on their chief?</p>

<p>To be sure, he was only a boy, but he had that
very day demonstrated that he had strength, skill,
and courage that any warrior of the tribe would
have found it hard to match.</p>

<p>“It cannot be that the elders of the tribe would
do harm to a stranger who came with his palms
out and put himself into their keeping,” said
Bomba. “That would bring on the people the
wrath of the gods.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“They do not fear the wrath of the gods as
much as they fear the wrath of Japazy,” returned
Solani. “The gods are very far away. Japazy
is near.”</p>

<p>No better proof than this statement, simply
made, could have been afforded of the tremendous
power exercised by the crafty half-breed
over the superstitious people through the strength
of his personality and his talk of ghosts and demons.</p>

<p>“What do the elders of the tribe say about
Bomba?” questioned the jungle lad, with an assumption
of carelessness that he was far from
feeling.</p>

<p>“They meet to-night to take counsel,” answered
Solani. “Then it will be known what they think
about the stranger and what they will do with
him.”</p>

<p>“Where do they meet?” asked Bomba, who
was already forming a plan of action.</p>

<p>“In the house of Abino, my father,” was the
answer.</p>

<p>“Is that the house where Bomba was taken
before he was brought to the house of Japazy?”
Bomba further queried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Solani.</p>

<p>“It is well,” said Bomba. “Their words will
be good words and they will do no harm to the
stranger that came to them in peace.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>Solani looked very doubtful as to that, but he
said no more, and Bomba himself did not prolong
the conversation. He was too busy with his
thoughts.</p>

<p>He could readily understand that, in order to
curry favor with the tyrant, they might make a
sacrifice of Bomba. It was for him to forestall
this, if possible, and to learn their plans before
they were put into execution.</p>

<p>“Has the stranger ever seen a cooanaradi?”
asked Solani unexpectedly, as he started to gather
up the dishes and the remnants of food.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bomba has seen them and slain them,”
answered the jungle boy. “They are the most
wicked snakes of the jungle. Why does Solani
ask?”</p>

<p>But Solani acted as though he had already said
too much and did not reply. He hastily finished
his task and disappeared. But as he went out of
the door he turned and looked once more at
Bomba with a long, lingering glance as though he
never expected to see him again.</p>

<p>The look made Bomba uneasy. What did
Solani know that he had been afraid to say?
That he meant to warn him to be on his guard
was evident. Probably even in going that far the
native lad had done what he had been forbidden
to do.</p>

<p>Bomba waited until it was fully dark. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
then within an hour of moonrise, and darkness
was needed for the plan that he had in mind.</p>

<p>He went stealthily through the house, examining
every room by the light of the torch he had
plucked from the wall. He thought that perhaps
some sentries were on guard to watch his movements.
But the dwelling appeared to be deserted.
It had probably been decided that any one who
had braved so many perils in coming to Jaguar
Island would not be inclined to leave it before his
mission had been accomplished.</p>

<p>Having ascertained to his satisfaction that no
one was lurking in the shadows, he went back to
his room and carefully examined his weapons.
Having found that they were in perfect order,
he extinguished the torch, after one last loving
look at the pictured face upon the wall, and
slipped out of the house like a shadow.</p>

<p>There was scarcely any one abroad. Doubtless
the fear that a jaguar might be lurking about kept
the inhabitants indoors after dark. Even if
Bomba should be met by any one, the probability
was that in the darkness he would pass as one of
their own people.</p>

<p>With the keen observation that had been sharpened
by his experience of the jungle, he had carefully
noted the location of Abino’s house and now
had no difficulty in finding it.</p>

<p>A flickering light from the torches within shone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
through the open windows. Avoiding the part
that fronted on the straggling street, Bomba
glided round to the back of the house and
crouched under one of the openings that served
as windows. That the conference was already in
session was evident from the hum of conversation
that came to the unseen listener.</p>

<p>The first word that Bomba could distinguish
was the last that he had heard from the lips of
Solani, “cooanaradi.” The coincidence sent a
shiver through his veins. That word of evil
omen, the word that stood for the fiercest and
deadliest snake in the Amazonian jungle! What
significance did it have in a conversation that presumably
concerned itself with Bomba?</p>

<p>The house was made of rough logs with many
crevices. Applying his eyes to one of these,
Bomba could see what was going on in the room
without the risk of discovery that would be involved
in lifting his head above the window sill.</p>

<p>In the room were gathered the same elders
with whom he had talked in the afternoon. To
their number had been added the warriors, Sunka
and Boshot, who had slain the jaguar in the
morning.</p>

<p>An expression of deep perplexity was visible
on all the dark faces. It was plain that the problem
with which they had to deal was giving them
a great deal of concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Bomba listened intently, trying not to lose a
syllable. Abino was speaking.</p>

<p>“It is certain that Japazy will not wish to see
the stranger,” he said. “Who would wish to see
the son of the man he had killed?”</p>

<p>“Is it known to Abino that Japazy killed the
stranger’s father?” asked Boshot.</p>

<p>“Japazy has not told it to Abino,” was the answer.
“But when Japazy has taken too much
intoxicating drink he has talked sometimes to
himself and Abino’s ears have been open to his
words. The stranger thinks his father’s name
was Bartow. When Japazy’s speech has been
thick he has spoken the name of Bartow and made
motions with his knife. Then he has said, ‘Bartow
is dead.’ Then Japazy has smiled as if he
were glad.”</p>

<p>“Did Japazy kill the stranger’s mother, too?”
asked Sunka.</p>

<p>“Abino does not know,” the native replied.
“Japazy has not spoken of that. But many times
he has gone to look at the woman’s face on the
wall, and when he turned away Japazy’s face was
net good to see.”</p>

<p>“It may be that Japazy has questions he would
ask of the stranger, as well as hear the stranger’s
questions,” put in one of the elders. “Japazy
may be angry if he comes back and finds the
stranger dead so that he may not speak with him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“He need not know that the stranger has been
here,” observed another of the group. “We can
put the people under silence so that they will not
speak of his coming.”</p>

<p>“That would be better than to have the stranger
kill Japazy,” remarked the eldest of the company.
“The stranger speaks smooth words, but
who knows what black thoughts are in his heart?
And if he wounds but does not kill Japazy, what
will Japazy do to us because we did not kill the
stranger when he came among us?”</p>

<p>That this consideration had weight was evident
from the grave expression of his hearers.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a terrific roar from
the volcano and the earth shook so violently under
Bomba’s feet that he was thrown headlong. For
several minutes the quake continued and then
gradually subsided.</p>

<p>When Bomba peered again through the crevice
he could note consternation on all faces.</p>

<p>“Tamura is angry,” declared Abino solemnly.
“To-day he has been more angry than for many
moons. Why is that? It is because to-day the
stranger came. He does not like the stranger.
He wants that he should die. Tamura has
spoken.”</p>

<p>A chill went through Bomba’s veins. It had
been very unlucky for him that the convulsion
should have come at the very moment that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
were debating his fate. Now, as he looked from
face to face, he could read his doom. To their
minds the god of the mountain had spoken, and
it only remained for them to bow to the decree.</p>

<p>There were whispers now, as though what they
were discussing was too horrid to be spoken of
aloud. Strain his ears as he might, Bomba could
catch but a single sentence:</p>

<p>“He shall die by the creeping death!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE FIRE STICK SPEAKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the utterance of their ominous words the
elderly natives rose to their feet, and it was evident
that the meeting was about to break up.</p>

<p>It would never do to be caught lurking there,
and Bomba was off like a flash. The darkness
had swallowed him up before any of the group
had come through the door.</p>

<p>Gliding along as silently as a ghost, he reached
the dwelling of Japazy. There was no sign of
any one having been there in his absence. Everything
was as he had left it, and a deathlike silence
wrapped the house like a garment.</p>

<p>Reaching his room he threw himself on the bed
to think. And if he ever needed to think swiftly
and think wisely, it was then.</p>

<p>Now he knew why Solani had looked at him so
sadly and lingeringly, as one looks on the face of
the dead. The native boy had already sensed the
turn that things were taking and felt that in fact,
if not in words, the stranger’s death had been
already decreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>But sometimes there is a long way between a
decree and its execution, and Bomba, despite the
awful peril in which he stood, was by no means
ready to concede that he was as good as dead.
Again and again he had faced death and escaped
by a hair’s breadth. And the quick wit and indomitable
daring that had saved him then were
his now.</p>

<p>He rapidly reviewed the possibilities in the
case. Two courses of action seemed open to him.
He could attempt to escape, to leave this terrible
island, cross the river and reach the mainland,
where he would be safe. Or he could stay and
face the enemies who were determined upon his
death and try in some way to defeat their purpose.</p>

<p>But if he adopted the first course, that would
be an end to his chance of finding speech with
Japazy. It would be putting aside his last chance
to get some knowledge of his parents, of answering
the questions that for months past had tormented
him.</p>

<p>The second course, Bomba had to admit to
himself, was so foolhardy as almost to smack of
insanity. What chance would he have to make
head against the warriors of the tribe if it came
to a battle? He could doubtless kill some of
them, but in the end they would overwhelm him
by sheer force of numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>But was there not a third course that offered
some chance of success? Suppose he did indeed
leave the village of Japazy, but still remain on
the island?</p>

<p>He felt sure that Japazy had gone to the
sunken city with the towers of gold. Doubtless
that was his treasure house, to which he had managed
in some way to find access and to which he
went from time to time to gather more riches.
Only in that way could the priceless objects already
in this house be accounted for.</p>

<p>But if he had gone there, he had gone by the
river and would have to return in the same way.
Bomba knew from the description of Hondura the
general direction of the sunken city. It lay to the
north. Why might not Bomba lurk about the
river bank to the north and descry Japazy’s coming?
Then he could boldly make himself known
and get the interview that he had come so far to
seek.</p>

<p>While he was immersed in these thoughts he
became conscious of a slight rustling. It was so
slight that none but a trained ear like that of
Bomba’s would have detected it at all.</p>

<p>But he heard it and was about to leap from the
bed to investigate, when he suddenly stiffened and
lay as though carved from stone. For in a beam
of moonlight that filtered through the window
he had caught sight of what looked like a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
black rope dragging itself over the sill of the
door.</p>

<p>But the long black rope was alive!</p>

<p>Bomba knew what it was, knew even before he
saw the glint of the evil eyes in the wicked head.
It was a cooanaradi, the most deadly and terrible
snake of the South American jungle, a species that
sometimes grows to twelve feet in length, is noted
for its ferocity and speed and its eagerness to
attack man even when retreat is possible. And
its bite means certain death.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke over Bomba. He did not
dare move a muscle.</p>

<p>A cooanaradi! Now Bomba knew what Solani
had meant. Now he fathomed the meaning of
that ominous phrase he had heard at the conference
of the elders:</p>

<p>“He shall die by the creeping death!”</p>

<p>The captive reptile had been brought to the
house and silently released. The Indians knew
that it would find its way to Bomba’s room by the
smell of the food that had twice been served in
it. Once in the room with Bomba, the cooanaradi
could be trusted to do the rest.</p>

<p>The infernal cunning of the scheme came to
Bomba like a flash. If Japazy on his return
should be vexed at not having spoken with
Bomba, the natives could point out that they were
not responsible—that the snake in some way had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
found its way into the house and killed the lad.
That would clear them from blame.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, Japazy should be relieved
at finding the boy dead, the perpetrators
could proudly boast their part in the deed and
count on the gratitude and perhaps the gifts of
the master.</p>

<p>There was a horrid, slithering sound as the
scaly body was dragged over the floor. The
deathlike stillness in which Bomba lay had thus
far prevented his detection. Luckily the bed lay
in the shadow.</p>

<p>The moonlight came into the room at an angle,
and it was intercepted by the branches of a tree
outside so that its beams were cast only at intervals
here and there. It was only when the rays
caught the long, black body that Bomba was able
to follow the course of the reptile about the room.
At other times he had to guess its location by the
horrid rustling that accompanied its progress.</p>

<p>There was a possible chance, Bomba thought,
that the snake, not finding the food it sought,
would curl up after a while and go to sleep. But
this hope was dissipated as he caught a glimpse
of the evil eyes that were darting in every direction.
Nothing was further from that messenger
of evil than sleep.</p>

<p>It was only a matter of time when the reptile
would reach the bed. Then the head would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
upreared. It was beyond possibility that it would
not detect the lad lying there, no matter how still
he kept.</p>

<p>Then would come a dart like lightning and the
terrible fangs, dripping with poison, would be imbedded
in the boy’s face or throat, and a very few
minutes later Bomba would be dead.</p>

<p>His weapons? The bow and arrow were out
of the question. Long before he could string his
arrow the snake would be upon him. The knife?
That might serve at close quarters, but that meant
he would be bitten first.</p>

<p>The fire stick!</p>

<p>Slowly, imperceptibly, Bomba’s right hand
stole to his pouch. It gripped the butt of the revolver.
Quite as slowly his hand came back holding
the weapon.</p>

<p>The slithering grew more distinct. The monster
was drawing nearer.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause. Then a long
rope seemed to rise from the floor and Bomba
found himself looking into the eyes of the cooanaradi.</p>

<p>The fire stick spoke!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>THE VOLCANO’S ROAR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Simultaneously</span> with the crack of the revolver
Bomba threw himself from the further
side of the bed to the floor.</p>

<p>There was a terrible thrashing about of the
reptile’s body, and Bomba knew that it had been
hit. But whether it was mortally or only slightly
wounded he could not tell.</p>

<p>He held the revolver in readiness for a second
shot, fearing every moment to see that dreadful
head reappear.</p>

<p>But no second shot was necessary. A few more
moments and the convulsive movements ceased.</p>

<p>The cooanaradi was dead!</p>

<p>With infinite caution Bomba tiptoed to the
other side of the bed. Now there was no doubt.
The reptile’s head was practically gone, shattered
into fragments by that first shot.</p>

<p>Bomba slumped down on the bed, hardly able
to believe in his good fortune. He caressed the
revolver lovingly and slipped in another cartridge
to take the place of the one that had done such
good service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>He had scarcely had time to collect his scattered
thoughts before there was a noise outside
as of people running. He looked out of the window
and saw a number of shadowy forms, thrown
into relief by the torches that they carried.</p>

<p>Some of the foremost halted under the window
and Bomba could recognize Abino, Sunka, and
Boshot, besides a couple of the elders who had
been at the conference.</p>

<p>They had reached there so quickly following
the shot that Bomba felt sure that they had been
lurking in the vicinity, waiting for the cooanaradi
to get in its deadly work.</p>

<p>Bomba smiled grimly to himself as he noted
that they stopped at the window. He well knew
why. Not one of them cared to come into a house
in which they believed a cooanaradi was wandering
around.</p>

<p>Then, like a flash, the thought came to him
that he might turn what threatened to be a calamity
into a blessing. Why should not the dead
serpent prove a protector, a guardian of the
dwelling? As long as they believed it was at
large not one would risk stepping foot inside the
door.</p>

<p>With this belief on the part of the Indians to
aid him, Bomba might be able to hold the place
until Japazy returned. At any rate, he would be
able to choose his own time for leaving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>There was a whispered consultation beneath
the window and then Abino called:</p>

<p>“Is the stranger still awake?”</p>

<p>Bomba waited for a moment and then leaned
out of the window.</p>

<p>“He is awake. Does Abino want to speak
words with him? Bomba’s ears are open.”</p>

<p>“Abino and the elders heard a great noise, and
they feared that harm had come to the stranger,”
the native returned. “They have come to help
him, if he is in trouble.”</p>

<p>To help him! The men who had sent the serpent
to strike him down!</p>

<p>Bomba’s blood boiled. But he restrained himself
with an effort, and his tone was silken as he
replied:</p>

<p>“It is good of Abino and the elders to want to
help Bomba. But he is not in trouble. But why
do Abino and the elders stand beneath the window?
Will they not come in and talk with
Bomba?”</p>

<p>In the moonlight he could see the movement
of horrified recoil at the suggestion, and again he
smiled grimly to himself.</p>

<p>“The stranger needs sleep,” replied Abino,
after a momentary pause. “It is not well for us
to talk with him when his eyes are heavy.”</p>

<p>“Bomba is not tired, and he would be glad to
speak words with Abino and the elders,” returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
the lad. “He is lonely. There is none
here for him to talk to except the cooanaradi.”</p>

<p>There was a gasp of amazement.</p>

<p>“The cooanaradi!” came in a chorus from
startled throats.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bomba, with an ostentatious
yawn. “The cooanaradi came in to talk with
Bomba. Bomba talked to him. Bomba knows
how to talk with the cooanaradi. He will not
hurt Bomba. Bomba has his hand on him now,”
and he reached down and touched the grisly
coils. “He will not hurt any one who does not
mean harm to Bomba.”</p>

<p>A yell of fright came from the superstitious natives.
What magic was this of which the stranger
was master, this mysterious lad who spoke of the
dreaded scourge of the jungle as though it were
a cooing dove, who could place his hand upon it
and still remain alive?</p>

<p>They turned to retreat in a flight of panic
when Bomba’s voice stayed them.</p>

<p>“Abino will send food to Bomba in the morning?”
he inquired.</p>

<p>There was a moment’s pause, and then Abino
replied in a trembling voice:</p>

<p>“Abino would not dare have Solani come into
the house where a cooanaradi is.”</p>

<p>Bomba seemed to consider this.</p>

<p>“It is well,” he replied. “Solani does not know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
how to talk to the cooanaradi as Bomba does.
But he can bring food beneath the window in a
basket and Bomba will draw it up.”</p>

<p>“Solani shall come,” promised Abino.</p>

<p>Their figures melted away in the distance and
Bomba chuckled as he turned away. His reputation
as a wizard was made. They were as afraid
of him as they were of death. Now he could rest
in tranquillity of soul until Japazy returned. For
the first time in his life a cooanaradi had proved
a friend—an involuntary friend, to be sure, but
none the less a friend.</p>

<p>Bomba threw himself on the bed and in a few
minutes was fast asleep.</p>

<p>For hours he slept.</p>

<p>Then came a tremendous roar, a fearful explosion
that sounded like the crack of doom!</p>

<p>Bomba sprang from his bed and rushed to the
window.</p>

<p>The heavens were a glare of red, and the glare
was fiercest over in the direction where Tamura
lay.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE ISLAND SINKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the crater of the volcano a great mass
of flame and smoke belched toward the sky. At
the peak rivers were forming, rivers of molten
lava, which, even as Bomba looked, began to
flow down the sides of the mountain in every
direction.</p>

<p>The fearful explosions still continued, and with
every one, that dreadful column of flame mounted
higher and the rivers of redhot lava increased
in volume. The earth was rocking in the throes
of an earthquake.</p>

<p>While Bomba was still trying to gather his
wits together and determine what he should do,
the house of Japazy split apart. Half of it went
down in a deafening crash, and the other half, in
which Bomba’s room was located, swayed crazily,
threatening at every instant to fall to the ground.</p>

<p>Bomba slung his bow over his shoulder and
rushed to the picture hanging on the wall. He
took it down—even in that moment of frenzied
haste he handled it reverently—and slipped the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
cord by which it had been suspended about his
neck, covering the picture under the puma skin
that stretched across his breast.</p>

<p>If he were doomed to die in this terrible cataclysm,
he would die with that picture next his
heart!</p>

<p>He glanced down the corridor and saw that it
was blocked with debris. His only exit was the
window. Luckily, it was not more than twelve
feet from the ground, and Bomba dropped down
safely.</p>

<p>He was not a moment too soon, for he had
barely got out of reach before the rest of the
building fell. The dwelling of Japazy, that had
witnessed nobody knew how many grim tragedies,
was now in ruins.</p>

<p>In the dim dawn that was coming up in the
eastern sky, Bomba could see that most of the
other houses in the town had shared the same
fate. People were rushing about in fright, men,
women and children, fleeing they knew not where,
their only thought to get away from the fiery
rivers of lava that were now pouring down rapidly
toward the doomed town.</p>

<p>The earth was opening in great rents, which
sometimes widened and at other times snapped
shut, engulfing houses, trees and sometimes hapless
human beings, whose screams of terror were
dreadful to hear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>Apart from these more spectacular demonstrations
of the unchained forces of nature, there was
a sense of gradual sinking that was sickening and
ominous in the extreme.</p>

<p>No one paid any attention to Bomba, so engrossed
was every one in trying to find a path to
safety.</p>

<p>The lad sniffed the air as a pointer does to get
his sense of direction. Then, when he knew that
he was headed for the north end of the island,
he plunged into the woods and went as straight
as an arrow to his goal.</p>

<p>There was terrible need for haste, as the rivers
of lava were now pouring into the woods, blasting
into ashes whatever they touched. If one of
those rivers intercepted his path, it would be impossible
to cross it.</p>

<p>The air was like that from a furnace, and
Bomba was drenched with sweat as he made his
way through the jungle. Showers of hot ashes
were falling all about him. Great forest trees lay
athwart his path, hurled to the ground as though
they had been saplings.</p>

<p>Over and over came those deafening roars
that seemed to split his eardrums, and ever the
rivers of lava swelled in volume. The hot blasts
that came from them scorched his throat and
lungs and seared his eyes. He felt as though he
were moving in a nightmare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>Now he was not alone. On every side the
jungle was full of fleeing animals and reptiles.
There were hundreds of them, the jaguars which
had given the island its name, boa constrictors,
dragging their huge lengths through the brush,
jararacas, cooanaradis.</p>

<p>They brushed against Bomba, bumped into him,
but not one of them gave him the slightest attention.
Every hostile and venomous instinct was
swallowed up in panic, in the terror to escape.
They did not know where they were going. They
did not care. All they thought of was to get away
from that roaring mountain, from those terrible
rivers of fire that threatened to overwhelm them.</p>

<p>Unexpectedly Bomba found himself on the edge
of the river, the same surging, turbulent stream
that had brought him to Jaguar Island. He was
surprised at this, as he had calculated that he had
at least a mile further to go before he reached its
banks.</p>

<p>And then he knew!</p>

<p>The river was creeping inland. It had already
covered the ground to the width of a mile. The
island was sinking!</p>

<p>With frantic haste Bomba gathered together
three logs, tore some creepers from the trees and
lashed the logs together. Even in the brief time
it took him to do this the water had deepened
until it was up to his neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>He pulled himself up on the rude and fragile
raft and committed himself to the river. Soon
the logs were in the grip of the current where
they tossed about so violently that Bomba could
not keep his feet. He threw himself flat and with
his hands through interstices of the logs held on
for his life.</p>

<p>He had little fear this time of the caymans.
They themselves would be cowering with terror
at this phenomenon that was shaking the bed of
the stream as well as the dry land above its level.
They would make no hostile move. Even the
jaguars, whose heads now dotted the stream
everywhere, could swim to the mainland without
any danger from an attack by the alligators.</p>

<p>The current carried the raft toward the further
side of the river, and before long it struck
heavily against a jutting point of land. With
one spring Bomba landed on the point, and a
moment later stood safe on the fringe of the
jungle.</p>

<p>As he looked toward the island there came a
stupendous crash that dwarfed everything that
had preceded. Once more Tamura belched forth
a great torrent of flame. Then the whole island
sank out of sight and where it had been were only
miles of widely tossing waters.</p>

<p>Bomba viewed the terrible spectacle with awe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
and consternation. The island where he had
hoped to learn so much no longer existed.</p>

<p>But he was safe! His life had been spared—and
that counted for much.</p>

<p>Then another comforting thought came to him.
The island of Japazy had sunk. But, as far as he
knew, Japazy himself still lived. He would find
the half-breed yet.</p>

<p>What fruit was borne by that determination
will be seen in the next volumes of this series:
“Bomba the Jungle Boy in the Abandoned City;
or, A Treasure Ten Thousand Years Old.”</p>

<p>“Japazy still lives,” murmured Bomba to himself.
“Bomba will seek him out.”</p>

<p>He took reverently from beneath the puma skin
the portrait of the lovely woman. Again those
beautiful eyes looked into his.</p>

<p>“Mother,” he whispered. “Mother!”</p>

<p>His eyes blurred. He pressed his lips to the
picture and replaced it next his heart.</p>

<p>Then he struck into the jungle.</p>
